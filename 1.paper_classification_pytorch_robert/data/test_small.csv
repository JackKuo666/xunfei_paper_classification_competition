To investigate this question, we study the 99 most popularlibraries available in Maven Central and the 865,560 client programs thatdeclare dependencies towards them, summing up to 2.3M dependencies. Our keyfindings are as follows: 43.5% of the dependencies declared by the clients arenot used in the bytecode; all APIs contain a large part of rarely used typesand a few frequently used types, and the ratio varies according to the natureof the API, its size and its design; we can systematically extract a reuse-corefrom APIs that is sufficient to provide for most clients, the median size ofthis subset is 17% of the API that can serve 83% of the clients. This study isnovel both in its scale and its findings about unused dependencies and thereuse-core of APIs. Our results provide concrete insights to improve Maven'sbuild process with a mechanism to detect unused dependencies. They also supportthe need to reduce the size of APIs to facilitate API learning and maintenance."
test_00001	Finding Higher Order Mutants Using Variational Execution	"  Mutation testing is an effective but time consuming method for gauging thequality of a test suite. It functions by repeatedly making changes, calledmutants, to the source code and checking whether the test suite fails (i.e.,whether the mutant is killed). Recent work has shown cases in which applyingmultiple changes, called a higher order mutation, is more difficult to killthan a single change, called a first order mutation. Specifically, a specialkind of higher order mutation, called a strongly subsuming higher ordermutation (SSHOM), can enable equivalent accuracy in assessing the quality ofthe test suite with fewer executions of tests. Little is known about theseSSHOMs, as they are difficult to find. Our goal in this research is to identifya faster, more reliable method for finding SSHOMs in order to characterize themin the future. We propose an approach based on variational execution to findSSHOMs. Preliminary results indicate that variational execution performs betterthan the existing genetic algorithm in terms of speed and completeness ofresults. Out of a set of 33 first order mutations, our variational executionapproach finds all 38 SSHOMs in 4.5 seconds, whereas the genetic algorithm onlyfinds 36 of the 38 SSHOMs in 50 seconds."
test_00002	"Automatic Detection of Search Tactic in Individual Information Seeking:  A Hidden Markov Model Approach"	"  Information seeking process is an important topic in information seekingbehavior research. Both qualitative and empirical methods have been adopted inanalyzing information seeking processes, with major focus on uncovering thelatent search tactics behind user behaviors. Most of the existing works requiredefining search tactics in advance and coding data manually. Among the fewworks that can recognize search tactics automatically, they missed making senseof those tactics. In this paper, we proposed using an automatic technique, i.e.the Hidden Markov Model (HMM), to explicitly model the search tactics. HMMresults show that the identified search tactics of individual informationseeking behaviors are consistent with Marchioninis Information seeking processmodel. With the advantages of showing the connections between search tacticsand search actions and the transitions among search tactics, we argue that HMMis a useful tool to investigate information seeking process, or at least itprovides a feasible way to analyze large scale dataset."
test_00003	Polygon Simplification by Minimizing Convex Corners	"  Let $P$ be a polygon with $r>0$ reflex vertices and possibly with holes andislands. A subsuming polygon of $P$ is a polygon $P'$ such that $P \subseteqP'$, each connected component $R$ of $P$ is a subset of a distinct connectedcomponent $R'$ of $P'$, and the reflex corners of $R$ coincide with those of$R'$. A subsuming chain of $P'$ is a minimal path on the boundary of $P'$ whosetwo end edges coincide with two edges of $P$. Aichholzer et al. proved thatevery polygon $P$ has a subsuming polygon with $O(r)$ vertices, and posed anopen problem to determine the computational complexity of computing subsumingpolygons with the minimum number of convex vertices.  We prove that the problem of computing an optimal subsuming polygon isNP-complete, but the complexity remains open for simple polygons (i.e.,polygons without holes). Our NP-hardness result holds even when the subsumingchains are restricted to have constant length and lie on the arrangement oflines determined by the edges of the input polygon. We show that thisrestriction makes the problem polynomial-time solvable for simple polygons."
test_00004	Differentially passive circuits that switch and oscillate	"  The concept of passivity is central to analyze circuits as interconnectionsof passive components. We illustrate that when used differentially, the sameconcept leads to an interconnection theory for electrical circuits that switchand oscillate as interconnections of passive components with operationalamplifiers (op-amps). The approach builds on recent results on dominance andp-passivity aimed at generalizing dissipativity theory to the analysis ofnon-equilibrium nonlinear systems. Our paper shows how those results apply tobasic and well-known nonlinear circuit architectures. They illustrate thepotential of dissipativity theory to design and analyze switching andoscillating circuits quantitatively, very much like their linear counterparts."
test_00005	Speed Scaling on Parallel Processors with Migration	"  We study the problem of scheduling a set of jobs with release dates,deadlines and processing requirements (or works), on parallel speed-scaledprocessors so as to minimize the total energy consumption. We consider thatboth preemption and migration of jobs are allowed. An exact polynomial-timealgorithm has been proposed for this problem, which is based on the Ellipsoidalgorithm. Here, we formulate the problem as a convex program and we propose asimpler polynomial-time combinatorial algorithm which is based on a reductionto the maximum flow problem. Our algorithm runs in $O(nf(n)logP)$ time, where$n$ is the number of jobs, $P$ is the range of all possible values ofprocessors' speeds divided by the desired accuracy and $f(n)$ is the complexityof computing a maximum flow in a layered graph with O(n) vertices.Independently, Albers et al. \cite{AAG11} proposed an $O(n^2f(n))$-timealgorithm exploiting the same relation with the maximum flow problem. We extendour algorithm to the multiprocessor speed scaling problem with migration wherethe objective is the minimization of the makespan under a budget of energy."
test_00006	On the Definition of Cyber-Physical Resilience in Power Systems	"  In recent years, advanced sensors, intelligent automation, communicationnetworks, and information technologies have been integrated into the electricgrid to enhance its performance and efficiency. Integrating these newtechnologies has resulted in more interconnections and interdependenciesbetween the physical and cyber components of the grid. Natural disasters andman-made perturbations have begun to threaten grid integrity more often. Urbaninfrastructure networks are highly reliant on the electric grid andconsequently, the vulnerability of infrastructure networks to electric gridoutages is becoming a major global concern. In order to minimize the economic,social, and political impacts of power system outages, the grid must beresilient. The concept of a power system cyber-physical resilience centersaround maintaining system states at a stable level in the presence ofdisturbances. Resilience is a multidimensional property of the electric grid,it requires managing disturbances originating from physical component failures,cyber component malfunctions, and human attacks. In the electric gridcommunity, there is not a clear and universally accepted definition ofcyber-physical resilience. This paper focuses on the definition of resiliencefor the electric grid and reviews key concepts related to system resilience.This paper aims to advance the field not only by adding cyber-physicalresilience concepts to power systems vocabulary, but also by proposing a newway of thinking about grid operation with unexpected disturbances and hazardsand leveraging distributed energy resources."
test_00007	"Automatic Generation of C-code or PLD Circuits under SFC Graphical  Environment"	"  This paper proposes a framework for automatic development of control systemsfrom a high level specification based in Grafcet formalism. Grafcet, orSequential Function Charts (SFC), is a special class of Petri Nets and isbecoming the standard representation for sequential control systems. Theproposed framework accepts a graphical (through ISaGRAPH) or textualbehavioural specification of the control system to be implemented. It followsthe usual procedure in software specification: the first step is to formallyvalidate the initial specification. Then the initial specification istranslated through automated processes into an implementation. At the momentthere are two possible output languages: C and Palasm [1]. The target processorfor the C code language are microcontroller based systems that require extendedtime constrains and access to external peripherals. The goal of including PLD'sis the possibility of automatically design mixed hardware and software systems."

In this paper, a system description of theframework used for VATEX-2020 video captioning challenge is presented. Weemploy an encoder-decoder based approach in which the visual features of thevideo are encoded using 3D convolutional neural network (C3D) and in thedecoding phase two Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent networks are used inwhich visual features and input captions are fused separately and final outputis generated by performing element-wise product between the output of bothLSTMs. Our model is able to achieve BLEU scores of 0.20 and 0.22 on public andprivate test data sets respectively."
test_00009	Ranking Templates for Linear Loops	"  We present a new method for the constraint-based synthesis of terminationarguments for linear loop programs based on linear ranking templates. Linearranking templates are parametrized, well-founded relations such that anassignment to the parameters gives rise to a ranking function. This approachgeneralizes existing methods and enables us to use templates for many differentranking functions with affine-linear components. We discuss templates formultiphase, piecewise, and lexicographic ranking functions. Because theseranking templates require both strict and non-strict inequalities, we useMotzkin's Transposition Theorem instead of Farkas Lemma to transform thegenerated $\exists\forall$-constraint into an $\exists$-constraint."
test_00010	"Deep convolutional neural networks for face and iris presentation attack  detection: Survey and case study"	"  Biometric presentation attack detection is gaining increasing attention.Users of mobile devices find it more convenient to unlock their smartapplications with finger, face or iris recognition instead of passwords. Inthis paper, we survey the approaches presented in the recent literature todetect face and iris presentation attacks. Specifically, we investigate theeffectiveness of fine tuning very deep convolutional neural networks to thetask of face and iris antispoofing. We compare two different fine tuningapproaches on six publicly available benchmark datasets. Results show theeffectiveness of these deep models in learning discriminative features that cantell apart real from fake biometric images with very low error rate.Cross-dataset evaluation on face PAD showed better generalization than state ofthe art. We also performed cross-dataset testing on iris PAD datasets in termsof equal error rate which was not reported in literature before. Additionally,we propose the use of a single deep network trained to detect both face andiris attacks. We have not noticed accuracy degradation compared to networkstrained for only one biometric separately. Finally, we analyzed the learnedfeatures by the network, in correlation with the image frequency components, tojustify its prediction decision."
test_00011	"Deciding Consistency of Databases Containing Defeasible and Strict  Information"	"  We propose a norm of consistency for a mixed set of defeasible and strictsentences, based on a probabilistic semantics. This norm establishes a cleardistinction between knowledge bases depicting exceptions and those containingoutright contradictions. We then define a notion of entailment based also onprobabilistic considerations and provide a characterization of the relationbetween consistency and entailment. We derive necessary and sufficientconditions for consistency, and provide a simple decision procedure for testingconsistency and deciding whether a sentence is entailed by a database. Finally,it is shown that if al1 sentences are Horn clauses, consistency and entailmentcan be tested in polynomial time."
test_00012	Simulation of the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol in OMNeT++	"  Real-time systems rely on a distributed global time base. As any physicalclock device suffers from noise, it is necessary to provide some kind of clocksynchronization to establish such a global time base. Different clocksynchronization methods have been invented for individual application domains.The Precision Time Protocol (PTP), which is specified in IEEE 1588, is anotherinteresting option. It targets local networks, where it is acceptable to assumesmall amounts of hardware support, and promises sub-microsecond precision. PTPprovides many different implementation and configuration options, and thus theDesign Space Exploration (DSE) is challenging. In this paper we discuss theimplementation of realistic clock noise and its synchronization via PTP inOMNeT++. The components presented in this paper are intended to assistengineers with the configuration of PTP networks."
test_00013	"Learning to Augment Expressions for Few-shot Fine-grained Facial  Expression Recognition"	"  Affective computing and cognitive theory are widely used in modernhuman-computer interaction scenarios. Human faces, as the most prominent andeasily accessible features, have attracted great attention from researchers.Since humans have rich emotions and developed musculature, there exist a lot offine-grained expressions in real-world applications. However, it is extremelytime-consuming to collect and annotate a large number of facial images, ofwhich may even require psychologists to correctly categorize them. To the bestof our knowledge, the existing expression datasets are only limited to severalbasic facial expressions, which are not sufficient to support our ambitions indeveloping successful human-computer interaction systems. To this end, a novelFine-grained Facial Expression Database - F2ED is contributed in this paper,and it includes more than 200k images with 54 facial expressions from 119persons. Considering the phenomenon of uneven data distribution and lack ofsamples is common in real-world scenarios, we further evaluate several tasks offew-shot expression learning by virtue of our F2ED, which are to recognize thefacial expressions given only few training instances. These tasks mimic humanperformance to learn robust and general representation from few examples. Toaddress such few-shot tasks, we propose a unified task-driven framework -Compositional Generative Adversarial Network (Comp-GAN) learning to synthesizefacial images and thus augmenting the instances of few-shot expression classes.Extensive experiments are conducted on F2ED and existing facial expressiondatasets, i.e., JAFFE and FER2013, to validate the efficacy of our F2ED inpre-training facial expression recognition network and the effectiveness of ourproposed approach Comp-GAN to improve the performance of few-shot recognitiontasks."
test_00014	"Architecture of monitoring elements for the network element modeling in  a Grid infrastructure"	"  Several tools exist that collect host-to-host connectivity measurements. Toimprove the usability of such measurements, they should be mapped into aframework consisting of complex subsystems, and the infrastructure thatconnects them. We introduce one such framework, and analyze the architecturalimplications on the network structure. In our framework, a complex subsystemconsists of several computing facilities and the infrastructure that connectsthem: we call it a -monitoring domain-. The task of measuring the connectivitybetween -monitoring domains- is considered distinct from the activity of-storage- and -computing- elements. Therefore we introduce a new element in ourtopology: we call it -theodolite- element, since its function is similar tothat of a transponder. Using these basic concepts, we analyze the architecturalimplications on the network structure: in a nutshell, if we want that-theodolites- serve as a reference, than the contribution to the relevantnetwork metrics due to the -monitoring domain- infrastructure must benegligible with respect to contributions of the inter-domain infrastructure. Inaddition all -theodolites- of a -monitoring domain- must give an image of theinter-domain infrastructure that is consistent with that experienced by networkapplications. We conclude giving a running SQL example of how information about-monitoring domains- and -theodolites- could be organized, and we outline theapplication of such framework in the GLUE schema activity for the networkelement"
test_00015	Edge User Allocation with Dynamic Quality of Service	"  In edge computing, edge servers are placed in close proximity to end-users.App vendors can deploy their services on edge servers to reduce network latencyexperienced by their app users. The edge user allocation (EUA) problemchallenges service providers with the objective to maximize the number ofallocated app users with hired computing resources on edge servers whileensuring their fixed quality of service (QoS), e.g., the amount of computingresources allocated to an app user. In this paper, we take a step forward toconsider dynamic QoS levels for app users, which generalizes but furthercomplicates the EUA problem, turning it into a dynamic QoS EUA problem. Thisenables flexible levels of quality of experience (QoE) for app users. Wepropose an optimal approach for finding a solution that maximizes app users'overall QoE. We also propose a heuristic approach for quickly findingsub-optimal solutions to large-scale instances of the dynamic QoS EUA problem.Experiments are conducted on a real-world dataset to demonstrate theeffectiveness and efficiency of our approaches against a baseline approach andthe state of the art."
test_00016	"Adaptive Teaching of Temporal Logic Formulas to Learners with  Preferences"	"  Machine teaching is an algorithmic framework for teaching a target hypothesisvia a sequence of examples or demonstrations. We investigate machine teachingfor temporal logic formulas -- a novel and expressive hypothesis class amenableto time-related task specifications. In the context of teaching temporal logicformulas, an exhaustive search even for a myopic solution takes exponentialtime (with respect to the time span of the task). We propose an efficientapproach for teaching parametric linear temporal logic formulas. Concretely, wederive a necessary condition for the minimal time length of a demonstration toeliminate a set of hypotheses. Utilizing this condition, we propose a myopicteaching algorithm by solving a sequence of integer programming problems. Wefurther show that, under two notions of teaching complexity, the proposedalgorithm has near-optimal performance. The results strictly generalize theprevious results on teaching preference-based version space learners. Weevaluate our algorithm extensively under a variety of learner types (i.e.,learners with different preference models) and interactive protocols (e.g.,batched and adaptive). The results show that the proposed algorithms canefficiently teach a given target temporal logic formula under various settings,and that there are significant gains of teaching efficacy when the teacheradapts to the learner's current hypotheses or uses oracles."
test_00017	"A survey on subjecting electronic product code and non-ID objects to IP  identification"	"  Over the last decade, both research on the Internet of Things (IoT) andreal-world IoT applications have grown exponentially. The IoT provides us withsmarter cities, intelligent homes, and generally more comfortable lives.However, the introduction of these devices has led to several new challengesthat must be addressed. One of the critical challenges facing interacting withIoT devices is to address billions of devices (things) around the world,including computers, tablets, smartphones, wearable devices, sensors, andembedded computers, and so on. This article provides a survey on subjectingElectronic Product Code and non-ID objects to IP identification for IoTdevices, including their advantages and disadvantages thereof. Differentmetrics are here proposed and used for evaluating these methods. In particular,the main methods are evaluated in terms of their: (i) computational overhead,(ii) scalability, (iii) adaptability, (iv) implementation cost, and (v) whetherapplicable to already ID-based objects and presented in tabular format.Finally, the article proves that this field of research will still be ongoing,but any new technique must favorably offer the mentioned five evaluativeparameters."
test_00018	"Synthesising a Database of Parameterised Linear and Non-Linear  Invariants for Time-Series Constraints"	"  Many constraints restricting the result of some computations over an integersequence can be compactly represented by register automata. We improve thepropagation of the conjunction of such constraints on the same sequence bysynthesising a database of linear and non-linear invariants using theirregister-automaton representation. The obtained invariants are formulaeparameterised by a function of the sequence length and proven to be true forany long enough sequence. To assess the quality of such linear invariants, wedeveloped a method to verify whether a generated linear invariant is a facet ofthe convex hull of the feasible points. This method, as well as the proof ofnon-linear invariants, are based on the systematic generation of constant-sizedeterministic finite automata that accept all integer sequences whose resultverifies some simple condition. We apply such methodology to a set of 44time-series constraints and obtain 1400 linear invariants from which 70% arefacet defining, and 600 non-linear invariants, which were tested on short-termelectricity production problems."
test_00019	Style and Content Disentanglement in Generative Adversarial Networks	"  Disentangling factors of variation within data has become a very challengingproblem for image generation tasks. Current frameworks for training aGenerative Adversarial Network (GAN), learn to disentangle the representationsof the data in an unsupervised fashion and capture the most significant factorsof the data variations. However, these approaches ignore the principle ofcontent and style disentanglement in image generation, which means theirlearned latent code may alter the content and style of the generated images atthe same time. This paper describes the Style and Content Disentangled GAN(SC-GAN), a new unsupervised algorithm for training GANs that learnsdisentangled style and content representations of the data. We assume that therepresentation of an image can be decomposed into a content code thatrepresents the geometrical information of the data, and a style code thatcaptures textural properties. Consequently, by fixing the style portion of thelatent representation, we can generate diverse images in a particular style.Reversely, we can set the content code and generate a specific scene in avariety of styles. The proposed SC-GAN has two components: a content code whichis the input to the generator, and a style code which modifies the scene stylethrough modification of the Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) layers'parameters. We evaluate the proposed SC-GAN framework on a set of baselinedatasets."
test_00020	Video Object Detection with an Aligned Spatial-Temporal Memory	"  We introduce Spatial-Temporal Memory Networks for video object detection. Atits core, a novel Spatial-Temporal Memory module (STMM) serves as the recurrentcomputation unit to model long-term temporal appearance and motion dynamics.The STMM's design enables full integration of pretrained backbone CNN weights,which we find to be critical for accurate detection. Furthermore, in order totackle object motion in videos, we propose a novel MatchTrans module to alignthe spatial-temporal memory from frame to frame. Our method producesstate-of-the-art results on the benchmark ImageNet VID dataset, and ourablative studies clearly demonstrate the contribution of our different designchoices. We release our code and models athttp://fanyix.cs.ucdavis.edu/project/stmn/project.html."
test_00021	A Formal Traffic Characterization of LTI Event-triggered Control Systems	"  Unnecessary communication and computation in the periodic execution ofcontrol tasks lead to over-provisioning in hardware design (orunderexploitation in hardware utilization) in control applications, such asnetworked control systems. To address these issues, researchers have proposed anew class of strategies, named event-driven strategies. Despite of theirbeneficiary effects, matters like task scheduling and appropriate dimensioningof communication components have become more complicated with respect totraditional periodic strategies. In this paper, we present a formal approach toderive an abstracted system that captures the sampling behavior of a family ofevent-triggered strategies for the case of LTI systems. This structureapproximately simulates the sampling behavior of the aperiodic control system.Furthermore, the resulting quotient system is equivalent to a timed automaton.In the construction of the abstraction, the state space is confined to a finitenumber of convex regions, each of which represents a mode in the quotientsystem. An LMI-based technique is deployed to derive a sampling time intervalassociated to each region. Finally, reachability analysis is leveraged to findthe transitions of the quotient system."

Prism is a new proof-of-workconsensus protocol that provably achieves throughput and latency up to physicallimits while retaining the strong guarantees of the longest chain protocol.This paper reports experimental results from implementations of two smartcontract virtual machines, EVM and MoveVM, on top of Prism and demonstratesthat the consensus bottleneck has been removed.
