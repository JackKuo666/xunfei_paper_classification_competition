train_07049	Parallel Search with no Coordination	  We consider a parallel version of a classical Bayesian search problem. $k$agents are looking for a treasure that is placed in one of the boxes indexed by$\mathbb{N}^+$ according to a known distribution $p$. The aim is to minimizethe expected time until the first agent finds it. Searchers run in parallelwhere at each time step each searcher can "peek" into a box. A basic family ofalgorithms which are inherently robust is \emph{non-coordinating} algorithms.Such algorithms act independently at each searcher, differing only by theirprobabilistic choices. We are interested in the price incurred by employingsuch algorithms when compared with the case of full coordination. We first showthat there exists a non-coordination algorithm, that knowing only the relativelikelihood of boxes according to $p$, has expected running time of at most$10+4(1+\frac{1}{k})^2 T$, where $T$ is the expected running time of the bestfully coordinated algorithm. This result is obtained by applying a refinedversion of the main algorithm suggested by Fraigniaud, Korman and Rodeh inSTOC'16, which was designed for the context of linear parallel search.We thendescribe an optimal non-coordinating algorithm for the case where thedistribution $p$ is known. The running time of this algorithm is difficult toanalyse in general, but we calculate it for several examples. In the case where$p$ is uniform over a finite set of boxes, then the algorithm just checks boxesuniformly at random among all non-checked boxes and is essentially $2$ timesworse than the coordinating algorithm.We also show simple algorithms for Paretodistributions over $M$ boxes. That is, in the case where $p(x) \sim 1/x^b$ for$0< b < 1$, we suggest the following algorithm: at step $t$ choose uniformlyfrom the boxes unchecked in ${1, . . . ,min(M, \lfloor t/\sigma\rfloor)}$,where $\sigma = b/(b + k - 1)$. It turns out this algorithm is asymptoticallyoptimal, and runs about $2+b$ times worse than the case of full coordination.	cs.DC
train_35390	Theory Exploration Powered By Deductive Synthesis	  Recent years have seen tremendous growth in the amount of verified software.Proofs for complex properties can now be achieved using higher-order theoriesand calculi. Complex properties lead to an ever-growing number of definitionsand associated lemmas, which constitute an integral part of proof construction.Following this -- whether automatic or semi-automatic -- methods forcomputer-aided lemma discovery have emerged. In this work, we introduce a newsymbolic technique for bottom-up lemma discovery, that is, the generation of alibrary of lemmas from a base set of inductive data types and recursivedefinitions. This is known as the theory exploration problem, and so far,solutions have been proposed based either on counter-example generation or themore prevalent random testing combined with first-order solvers. Our newapproach, being purely deductive, eliminates the need for random testing as afiltering phase and for SMT solvers. Therefore it is amenable compositionalreasoning and for the treatment of user-defined higher-order functions. Ourimplementation has shown to find more lemmas than prior art, while avoidingredundancy.	cs.PL

train_02120	Can Microsoft Academic assess the early citation impact of in-press  articles? A multi-discipline exploratory analysis	  Many journals post accepted articles online before they are formallypublished in an issue. Early citation impact evidence for these articles couldbe helpful for timely research evaluation and to identify potentially importantarticles that quickly attract many citations. This article investigates whetherMicrosoft Academic can help with this task. For over 65,000 Scopus in-pressarticles from 2016 and 2017 across 26 fields, Microsoft Academic found 2-5times as many citations as Scopus, depending on year and field. From manualchecks of 1,122 Microsoft Academic citations not found in Scopus, MicrosoftAcademic's citation indexing was faster but not much wider than Scopus forjournals. It achieved this by associating citations to preprints with theirsubsequent in-press versions and by extracting citations from in-pressarticles. In some fields its coverage of scholarly digital libraries, such asarXiv.org, was also an advantage. Thus, Microsoft Academic seems to be a morecomprehensive automatic source of citation counts for in-press articles thanScopus.	cs.DL

Such attacks may cause damage on a fairly large scale especiallysince they are difficult to detect and there has been no universally acceptedscheme to counter them as yet. In this paper, we discuss the different kinds ofSybil attacks including those occurring in peer-to-peer reputation systems,self-organising networks and even social network systems. In addition, variousmethods that have been suggested over time to decrease or eliminate their riskcompletely are also analysed along with their modus operandi.	cs.CR
train_32944	Finding Safety in Numbers with Secure Allegation Escrows	  For fear of retribution, the victim of a crime may be willing to report itonly if other victims of the same perpetrator also step forward. Commonexamples include 1) identifying oneself as the victim of sexual harassment,especially by a person in a position of authority or 2) accusing an influentialpolitician, an authoritarian government, or ones own employer of corruption. Tohandle such situations, legal literature has proposed the concept of anallegation escrow: a neutral third-party that collects allegations anonymously,matches them against each other, and de-anonymizes allegers only afterde-anonymity thresholds (in terms of number of co-allegers), pre-specified bythe allegers, are reached.  An allegation escrow can be realized as a single trusted third party;however, this party must be trusted to keep the identity of the alleger andcontent of the allegation private. To address this problem, this paperintroduces Secure Allegation Escrows (SAE, pronounced "say"). A SAE is a groupof parties with independent interests and motives, acting jointly as an escrowfor collecting allegations from individuals, matching the allegations, andde-anonymizing the allegations when designated thresholds are reached. Bydesign, SAEs provide a very strong property: No less than a majority of partiesconstituting a SAE can de-anonymize or disclose the content of an allegationwithout a sufficient number of matching allegations (even in collusion with anynumber of other allegers). Once a sufficient number of matching allegationsexist, the join escrow discloses the allegation with the allegers' identities.We describe how SAEs can be constructed using a novel authentication protocoland a novel allegation matching and bucketing algorithm, provide formal proofsof the security of our constructions, and evaluate a prototype implementation,demonstrating feasibility in practice.	cs.CR

Instead, she has access to severalmodels that map histories of past interactions to states. Here we improve overknown regret bounds in this setting, and more importantly generalize to thecase where the models given to the learner do not contain a true modelresulting in an MDP representation but only approximations of it. We also giveimproved error bounds for state aggregation.	cs.LG

The latter is the main task,which can exploit the previous two for achieving better results. Our DNN istrained jointly on all the three cQA tasks and learns to encode questions andcomments into a single vector representation shared across the multiple tasks.The results on the official challenge test set show that our approach produceshigher accuracy and faster convergence rates than the individual neuralnetworks. Additionally, our method, which does not use any manual featureengineering, approaches the state of the art established with methods that makeheavy use of it.	cs.CL
train_21175	Scaling algorithms for approximate and exact maximum weight matching	  The {\em maximum cardinality} and {\em maximum weight matching} problems canbe solved in time $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$, a bound that has resisted improvementdespite decades of research. (Here $m$ and $n$ are the number of edges andvertices.) In this article we demonstrate that this "$m\sqrt{n}$ barrier" isextremely fragile, in the following sense. For any $\epsilon>0$, we give analgorithm that computes a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximate maximum weight matching in$O(m\epsilon^{-1}\log\epsilon^{-1})$ time, that is, optimal {\em linear time}for any fixed $\epsilon$. Our algorithm is dramatically simpler than the bestexact maximum weight matching algorithms on general graphs and should beappealing in all applications that can tolerate a negligible relative error.  Our second contribution is a new {\em exact} maximum weight matchingalgorithm for integer-weighted bipartite graphs that runs in time$O(m\sqrt{n}\log N)$. This improves on the $O(Nm\sqrt{n})$-time and$O(m\sqrt{n}\log(nN))$-time algorithms known since the mid 1980s, for $1\ll\log N \ll \log n$. Here $N$ is the maximum integer edge weight.	cs.DS

train_27024	Secure Phrase Search for Intelligent Processing of Encrypted Data in  Cloud-Based IoT	  Phrase search allows retrieval of documents containing an exact phrase, whichplays an important role in many machine learning applications for cloud-basedIoT, such as intelligent medical data analytics. In order to protect sensitiveinformation from being leaked by service providers, documents (e.g., clinicrecords) are usually encrypted by data owners before being outsourced to thecloud. This, however, makes the search operation an extremely challenging task.Existing searchable encryption schemes for multi-keyword search operations failto perform phrase search, as they are unable to determine the locationrelationship of multiple keywords in a queried phrase over encrypted data onthe cloud server side. In this paper, we propose P3, an efficientprivacy-preserving phrase search scheme for intelligent encrypted dataprocessing in cloud-based IoT. Our scheme exploits the homomorphic encryptionand bilinear map to determine the location relationship of multiple queriedkeywords over encrypted data. It also utilizes a probabilistic trapdoorgeneration algorithm to protect users search patterns. Thorough securityanalysis demonstrates the security guarantees achieved by P3. We implement aprototype and conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets. Theevaluation results show that compared with existing multikeyword searchschemes, P3 can greatly improve the search accuracy with moderate overheads.	cs.CR

train_43956	Semantic Example Guided Image-to-Image Translation	  Many image-to-image (I2I) translation problems are in nature of highdiversity that a single input may have various counterparts. Prior worksproposed the multi-modal network that can build a many-to-many mapping betweentwo visual domains. However, most of them are guided by sampled noises. Someothers encode the reference images into a latent vector, by which the semanticinformation of the reference image will be washed away. In this work, we aim toprovide a solution to control the output based on references semantically.Given a reference image and an input in another domain, a semantic matching isfirst performed between the two visual contents and generates the auxiliaryimage, which is explicitly encouraged to preserve semantic characteristics ofthe reference. A deep network then is used for I2I translation and the finaloutputs are expected to be semantically similar to both the input and thereference; however, no such paired data can satisfy that dual-similarity in asupervised fashion, so we build up a self-supervised framework to serve thetraining purpose. We improve the quality and diversity of the outputs byemploying non-local blocks and a multi-task architecture. We assess theproposed method through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations andalso presented comparisons with several state-of-art models.	cs.CV

Despite this, human aspects areunder-represented in technical debt research, perhaps because they arechallenging to valorize.  This study's objective was to investigate the relationship between technicaldebt and affective states (feelings, emotions, and moods) from softwarepractitioners. Forty participants from twelve companies took part in amixed-methods design, consisting of a repeated-measures experiment, a surveyemploying a questionnaire, and semi-structured interviews.  The statistical analysis shows that different design smells negatively orpositively impact affective states. From the qualitative data, it is clear thattechnical debt activates a substantial portion of the emotional room and ispsychologically taxing. Further, reactions to technical debt appear to fall indifferent levels of maturity.  We argue that human aspects in software engineering are an essential factorto consider, as it can result in, e.g., procrastination, apprehension, andburnout.	cs.SE

Predicting Current City from Profile and Social  Relationship	  Privacy has become a major concern in Online Social Networks (OSNs) due tothreats such as advertising spam, online stalking and identity theft. Althoughmany users hide or do not fill out their private attributes in OSNs, priorstudies point out that the hidden attributes may be inferred from some otherpublic information. Thus, users' private information could still be at stake tobe exposed. Hitherto, little work helps users to assess the exposureprobability/risk that the hidden attributes can be correctly predicted, letalone provides them with pointed countermeasures. In this article, we focus ourstudy on the exposure risk assessment by a particular privacy-sensitiveattribute - current city - in Facebook. Specifically, we first design a novelcurrent city prediction approach that discloses users' hidden `current city'from their self-exposed information. Based on 371,913 Facebook users' data, weverify that our proposed prediction approach can predict users' current citymore accurately than state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we inspect theprediction results and model the current city exposure probability via somemeasurable characteristics of the self-exposed information. Finally, weconstruct an exposure estimator to assess the current city exposure risk forindividual users, given their self-exposed information. Several case studiesare presented to illustrate how to use our proposed estimator for privacyprotection.	cs.SI

Inspired by aBayesian approach in [1], in this paper, we explore a Bayesian model selectionmethod for identifying the connectivity of networks of transfer functions,without the need to estimate the dynamics. The algorithm employs a Bayesianmeasure and a forward-backward search algorithm. To obtain the Bayesianmeasure, the impulse responses of network modules are modeled as Gaussianprocesses and the hyperparameters are estimated by marginal likelihoodmaximization using the expectation-maximization algorithm. Numerical resultsdemonstrate the effectiveness of this method.	cs.SY

Yet, despite theongoing rapid growth of computational tools within this realm, currentdevelopments are bottlenecked by the lack of an effective simulation method. Asa result, existing design tools must trade-off between speed and accuracy tosupport a real-time interactive design scenario. In response, we introduceSimuLearn, a data-driven method that combines finite element analysis andmachine learning to create real-time (0.61 seconds) and truthful (97% accuracy)morphing material simulators. We use mesh-like 4D printed structures tocontextualize this method and prototype design tools to exemplify the designworkflows and spaces enabled by a fast and accurate simulation method.Situating this work among existing literature, we believe SimuLearn is a timelyaddition to the HCI CAD toolbox that can enable the proliferation of morphingmaterials.	cs.HC

While most existing studies on knowledge graph (KG) reasoningassume enough training examples, we study the challenging and practical problemof few-shot knowledge graph reasoning under the paradigm of meta-learning. Wepropose a new meta learning framework that effectively utilizes thetask-specific meta information such as local graph neighbors and reasoningpaths in KGs. Specifically, we design a meta-encoder that encodes the metainformation into task-specific initialization parameters for different tasks.This allows our reasoning module to have diverse starting points when learningto reason over different relations, which is expected to better fit the targettask. On two few-shot knowledge base completion benchmarks, we show that theaugmented task-specific meta-encoder yields much better initial point than MAMLand outperforms several few-shot learning baselines.	cs.CL

Data processing engines such asDruid and Spark use mergeable summaries to estimate quantiles, but summarymerge times can be a bottleneck during aggregation. We show how a compact andefficiently mergeable quantile sketch can support aggregation workloads. Thisdata structure, which we refer to as the moments sketch, operates with a smallmemory footprint (200 bytes) and computationally efficient (50ns) merges bytracking only a set of summary statistics, notably the sample moments. Wedemonstrate how we can efficiently and practically estimate quantiles using themethod of moments and the maximum entropy principle, and show how the use of acascade further improves query time for threshold predicates. Empiricalevaluation on real-world datasets shows that the moments sketch can achieveless than 1 percent error with 15 times less merge overhead than comparablesummaries, improving end query time in the MacroBase engine by up to 7 timesand the Druid engine by up to 60 times.	cs.DB
train_32531	Object Skeleton Extraction in Natural Images by Fusing Scale-associated  Deep Side Outputs	  Object skeleton is a useful cue for object detection, complementary to theobject contour, as it provides a structural representation to describe therelationship among object parts. While object skeleton extraction in naturalimages is a very challenging problem, as it requires the extractor to be ableto capture both local and global image context to determine the intrinsic scaleof each skeleton pixel. Existing methods rely on per-pixel based multi-scalefeature computation, which results in difficult modeling and high timeconsumption. In this paper, we present a fully convolutional network withmultiple scale-associated side outputs to address this problem. By observingthe relationship between the receptive field sizes of the sequential stages inthe network and the skeleton scales they can capture, we introduce ascale-associated side output to each stage. We impose supervision to differentstages by guiding the scale-associated side outputs toward groundtruthskeletons of different scales. The responses of the multiple scale-associatedside outputs are then fused in a scale-specific way to localize skeleton pixelswith multiple scales effectively. Our method achieves promising results on twoskeleton extraction datasets, and significantly outperforms other competitors.	cs.CV

A key knowledge of image steganalyzer, which combines relevantimage features and innovative classification procedures, can be deduced by adeep learning approach called Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). These kindof deep learning networks is so well-suited for classification tasks based onthe detection of variations in 2D shapes that it is the state-of-the-art inmany image recognition problems. In this article, we design a CNN-basedsteganalyzer for images obtained by applying steganography with a uniqueembedding key. This one is quite different from the previous study of {\em Qianet al.} and its successor, namely {\em Pibre et al.} The proposed architectureembeds less convolutions, with much larger filters in the final convolutionallayer, and is more general: it is able to deal with larger images and lowerpayloads. For the "same embedding key" scenario, our proposal outperforms allother steganalyzers, in particular the existing CNN-based ones, and defeatsmany state-of-the-art image steganography schemes.	cs.MM

train_12264	Exploration of Faulty Hamiltonian Graphs	  We consider the problem of exploration of networks, some of whose edges arefaulty. A mobile agent, situated at a starting node and unaware of which edgesare faulty, has to explore the connected fault-free component of this node byvisiting all of its nodes. The cost of the exploration is the number of edgetraversals. For a given network and given starting node, the overhead of anexploration algorithm is the worst-case ratio (taken over all faultconfigurations) of its cost to the cost of an optimal algorithm which knowswhere faults are situated. An exploration algorithm, for a given network andgiven starting node, is called perfectly competitive if its overhead is thesmallest among all exploration algorithms not knowing the location of faults.We design a perfectly competitive exploration algorithm for any ring, and showthat, for networks modeled by hamiltonian graphs, the overhead of any DFSexploration is at most 10/9 times larger than that of a perfectly competitivealgorithm. Moreover, for hamiltonian graphs of size at least 24, this overheadis less than 6% larger than that of a perfectly competitive algorithm.	cs.DS

Given the increasing volume of data, it is difficult to perform akNN join on a centralized machine efficiently. In this paper, we investigatehow to perform kNN join using MapReduce which is a well-accepted framework fordata-intensive applications over clusters of computers. In brief, the mapperscluster objects into groups; the reducers perform the kNN join on each group ofobjects separately. We design an effective mapping mechanism that exploitspruning rules for distance filtering, and hence reduces both the shuffling andcomputational costs.

In face recognition, large poseand illumination variation of face images has been a key factor for performancedegradation. However, human annotation for the various face understanding tasksincluding face landmark localization, face attributes classification and facerecognition under these challenging scenarios are highly costly to acquire.Therefore, it would be desirable to perform data augmentation for these cases.But simple 2D data augmentation techniques on the image domain are not able tosatisfy the requirement of these challenging cases. As such, 3D face modeling,in particular, single image 3D face modeling, stands a feasible solution forthese challenging conditions beyond 2D based data augmentation. To this end, wepropose a method that produces realistic 3D augmented images from multipleviewpoints with different illumination conditions through 3D face modeling,each associated with geometrically accurate face landmarks, attributes andidentity information. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed 3D dataaugmentation method significantly improves the performance and robustness ofvarious face understanding tasks while achieving state-of-arts on multiplebenchmarks.	cs.CV

train_06327	Learning Aerial Image Segmentation from Online Maps	  This study deals with semantic segmentation of high-resolution (aerial)images where a semantic class label is assigned to each pixel via supervisedclassification as a basis for automatic map generation. Recently, deepconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown impressive performance and havequickly become the de-facto standard for semantic segmentation, with the addedbenefit that task-specific feature design is no longer necessary. However, amajor downside of deep learning methods is that they are extremely data-hungry,thus aggravating the perennial bottleneck of supervised classification, toobtain enough annotated training data. On the other hand, it has been observedthat they are rather robust against noise in the training labels. This opens upthe intriguing possibility to avoid annotating huge amounts of training data,and instead train the classifier from existing legacy data or crowd-sourcedmaps which can exhibit high levels of noise. The question addressed in thispaper is: can training with large-scale, publicly available labels replace asubstantial part of the manual labeling effort and still achieve sufficientperformance? Such data will inevitably contain a significant portion of errors,but in return virtually unlimited quantities of it are available in largerparts of the world. We adapt a state-of-the-art CNN architecture for semanticsegmentation of buildings and roads in aerial images, and compare itsperformance when using different training data sets, ranging from manuallylabeled, pixel-accurate ground truth of the same city to automatic trainingdata derived from OpenStreetMap data from distant locations. We report ourresults that indicate that satisfying performance can be obtained withsignificantly less manual annotation effort, by exploiting noisy large-scaletraining data.	cs.CV

Next, considering different internal and external conditions, wedevelop three controllers according to different model precision. Specifically,based on accurate model, an open-loop controller is realized by combiningpiece-wise constant curvature (PCC) modeling method and machine learningmethod. Based on inaccurate model, a feedback controller, using estimatedJacobian, is realized in 3D space. A model-free controller, using reinforcementlearning to learn a control policy rather than a model, is realized in 2Dplane, with minimal training data. Then, these three control methods arecompared on a same experiment platform to explore the applicability ofdifferent methods under different conditions. Lastly, we figure out that softarm can greatly simplify the perception, planning, and control of interactiontasks through its compliance, which is its main advantage over the rigid arm.Through plentiful experiments in three interaction application scenarios,human-robot interaction, free space interaction task, and confined spaceinteraction task, we demonstrate the potential application prospect of the softarm.	cs.RO
train_10685	Bipartitioning Problems on Graphs with Bounded Tree-Width	  For an undirected graph G, we consider the following problems: given a fixedgraph H, can we partition the vertices of G into two non-empty sets A and Bsuch that neither the induced graph G[A] nor G[B] contain H (i) as a subgraph?(ii) as an induced subgraph? These problems are NP-complete and are expressiblein monadic second order logic (MSOL). The MSOL formulation, together withCourcelle's theorem implies linear time solvability on graphs with boundedtree-width. This approach yields algorithms with running time f(|phi|, t) * n,where |phi| is the length of the MSOL formula, t is the tree-width of the graphand n is the number of vertices of the graph. The dependency of f(|phi|, t) on|phi| can be as bad as a tower of exponentials.  In this paper, we present explicit combinatorial algorithms for theseproblems for graphs G whose tree-width is bounded. We obtain 2^{O(t^r)} * ntime algorithms when H is any fixed graph of order r. In the special case whenH = K_r, a complete graph on r vertices, we get an 2^{O(t+r \log t)} * n timealgorithm.  The techniques can be extended to provide FPT algorithms to determine thesmallest number q such that V can be partitioned into q parts such that none ofthe parts have H as a subgraph (induced subgraph).	cs.DS

train_49759	Rule-Mining based classification: a benchmark study	  This study proposed an exhaustive stable/reproducible rule-mining algorithmcombined to a classifier to generate both accurate and interpretable models.Our method first extracts rules (i.e., a conjunction of conditions about thevalues of a small number of input features) with our exhaustive rule-miningalgorithm, then constructs a new feature space based on the most relevant rulescalled "local features" and finally, builds a local predictive model bytraining a standard classifier on the new local feature space. This localfeature space is easy interpretable by providing a human-understandableexplanation under the explicit form of rules. Furthermore, our local predictiveapproach is as powerful as global classical ones like logistic regression (LR),support vector machine (SVM) and rules based methods like random forest (RF)and gradient boosted tree (GBT).	cs.LG
train_32648	Rigid Body Structure and Motion From Two-Frame Point-Correspondences  Under Perspective Projection	  This paper is concerned with possibility of recovery of motion and structureparameters from multiframes under perspective projection when only points on arigid body are traced. Free (unrestricted and uncontrolled) pattern of motionbetween frames is assumed. The major question is how many points and/or howmany frames are necessary for the task. It has been shown in an earlier paper{Klopotek:95b} that for orthogonal projection two frames are insufficient forthe task. The paper demonstrates that, under perspective projection, that totaluncertainty about relative position of focal point versus projection planemakes the recovery of structure and motion from two frames impossible.	cs.CV
train_38819	Deep Clustering for Unsupervised Learning of Visual Features	  Clustering is a class of unsupervised learning methods that has beenextensively applied and studied in computer vision. Little work has been doneto adapt it to the end-to-end training of visual features on large scaledatasets. In this work, we present DeepCluster, a clustering method thatjointly learns the parameters of a neural network and the cluster assignmentsof the resulting features. DeepCluster iteratively groups the features with astandard clustering algorithm, k-means, and uses the subsequent assignments assupervision to update the weights of the network. We apply DeepCluster to theunsupervised training of convolutional neural networks on large datasets likeImageNet and YFCC100M. The resulting model outperforms the current state of theart by a significant margin on all the standard benchmarks.	cs.CV
train_06506	Mixture of Counting CNNs: Adaptive Integration of CNNs Specialized to  Specific Appearance for Crowd Counting	  This paper proposes a crowd counting method. Crowd counting is difficultbecause of large appearance changes of a target which caused by density andscale changes. Conventional crowd counting methods generally utilize onepredictor (e,g., regression and multi-class classifier). However, such only onepredictor can not count targets with large appearance changes well. In thispaper, we propose to predict the number of targets using multiple CNNsspecialized to a specific appearance, and those CNNs are adaptively selectedaccording to the appearance of a test image. By integrating the selected CNNs,the proposed method has the robustness to large appearance changes. Inexperiments, we confirm that the proposed method can count crowd with lowercounting error than a CNN and integration of CNNs with fixed weights. Moreover,we confirm that each predictor automatically specialized to a specificappearance.	cs.CV

The elements of a game design framework for avoiding phishing attackswere used to address the game design issues. Game design principles served asguidelines for structuring and presenting information. Our mobile game designaimed to enhance the users' avoidance behaviour through motivation to protectthemselves against phishing threats. A think-aloud study was conducted, alongwith a pre- and post-test, to assess the game design framework though thedeveloped mobile game prototype. The study results showed a significantimprovement of participants' phishing avoidance behaviour in their post-testassessment. Furthermore, the study findings suggest that participants' threatperception, safeguard effectiveness, self-efficacy, perceived severity andperceived susceptibility elements positively impact threat avoidance behaviour,whereas safeguard cost had a negative impact on it.	cs.CY
train_13101	Text-Independent Speaker Verification Using 3D Convolutional Neural  Networks	  In this paper, a novel method using 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN)architecture has been proposed for speaker verification in the text-independentsetting. One of the main challenges is the creation of the speaker models. Mostof the previously-reported approaches create speaker models based on averagingthe extracted features from utterances of the speaker, which is known as thed-vector system. In our paper, we propose an adaptive feature learning byutilizing the 3D-CNNs for direct speaker model creation in which, for bothdevelopment and enrollment phases, an identical number of spoken utterances perspeaker is fed to the network for representing the speakers' utterances andcreation of the speaker model. This leads to simultaneously capturing thespeaker-related information and building a more robust system to cope withwithin-speaker variation. We demonstrate that the proposed method significantlyoutperforms the traditional d-vector verification system. Moreover, theproposed system can also be an alternative to the traditional d-vector systemwhich is a one-shot speaker modeling system by utilizing 3D-CNNs.	cs.CV
train_12082	On the Price of Stability of Undirected Multicast Games	  In multicast network design games, a set of agents choose paths from theirsource locations to a common sink with the goal of minimizing their individualcosts, where the cost of an edge is divided equally among the agents using it.Since the work of Anshelevich et al. (FOCS 2004) that introduced network designgames, the main open problem in this field has been the price of stability(PoS) of multicast games. For the special case of broadcast games (every vertexis a terminal, i.e., has an agent), a series of works has culminated in aconstant upper bound on the PoS (Bilo` et al., FOCS 2013). However, nosignificantly sub-logarithmic bound is known for multicast games. In thispaper, we make progress toward resolving this question by showing a constantupper bound on the PoS of multicast games for quasi-bipartite graphs. These aregraphs where all edges are between two terminals (as in broadcast games) orbetween a terminal and a nonterminal, but there is no edge betweennonterminals. This represents a natural class of intermediate generalitybetween broadcast and multicast games. In addition to the result itself, ourtechniques overcome some of the fundamental difficulties of analyzing the PoSof general multicast games, and are a promising step toward resolving thismajor open problem.	cs.DS
train_16023	Second-Order NLP Adversarial Examples	  Adversarial example generation methods in NLP rely on models like languagemodels or sentence encoders to determine if potential adversarial examples arevalid. In these methods, a valid adversarial example fools the model beingattacked, and is determined to be semantically or syntactically valid by asecond model. Research to date has counted all such examples as errors by theattacked model. We contend that these adversarial examples may not be flaws inthe attacked model, but flaws in the model that determines validity. We termsuch invalid inputs second-order adversarial examples. We propose theconstraint robustness curve and associated metric ACCS as tools for evaluatingthe robustness of a constraint to second-order adversarial examples. Togenerate this curve, we design an adversarial attack to run directly on thesemantic similarity models. We test on two constraints, the Universal SentenceEncoder (USE) and BERTScore. Our findings indicate that such second-orderexamples exist, but are typically less common than first-order adversarialexamples in state-of-the-art models. They also indicate that USE is effectiveas constraint on NLP adversarial examples, while BERTScore is nearlyineffectual. Code for running the experiments in this paper is available athttps://github.com/jxmorris12/second-order-adversarial-examples.	cs.CL
train_01717	Synthesizing Datalog Programs Using Numerical Relaxation	  The problem of learning logical rules from examples arises in diverse fields,including program synthesis, logic programming, and machine learning. Existingapproaches either involve solving computationally difficult combinatorialproblems, or performing parameter estimation in complex statistical models.  In this paper, we present Difflog, a technique to extend the logicprogramming language Datalog to the continuous setting. By attachingreal-valued weights to individual rules of a Datalog program, we naturallyassociate numerical values with individual conclusions of the program.Analogous to the strategy of numerical relaxation in optimization problems, wecan now first determine the rule weights which cause the best agreement betweenthe training labels and the induced values of output tuples, and subsequentlyrecover the classical discrete-valued target program from the continuousoptimum.  We evaluate Difflog on a suite of 34 benchmark problems from recentliterature in knowledge discovery, formal verification, and databasequery-by-example, and demonstrate significant improvements in learning complexprograms with recursive rules, invented predicates, and relations of arbitraryarity.	cs.AI
train_19442	A Tree-based Decoder for Neural Machine Translation	  Recent advances in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) show that addingsyntactic information to NMT systems can improve the quality of theirtranslations. Most existing work utilizes some specific types oflinguistically-inspired tree structures, like constituency and dependency parsetrees. This is often done via a standard RNN decoder that operates on alinearized target tree structure. However, it is an open question of whatspecific linguistic formalism, if any, is the best structural representationfor NMT. In this paper, we (1) propose an NMT model that can naturally generatethe topology of an arbitrary tree structure on the target side, and (2)experiment with various target tree structures. Our experiments show thesurprising result that our model delivers the best improvements with balancedbinary trees constructed without any linguistic knowledge; this modeloutperforms standard seq2seq models by up to 2.1 BLEU points, and other methodsfor incorporating target-side syntax by up to 0.7 BLEU.	cs.CL
train_21435	A Bit-Compatible Shared Memory Parallelization for ILU(k)  Preconditioning and a Bit-Compatible Generalization to Distributed Memory	  ILU(k) is a commonly used preconditioner for iterative linear solvers forsparse, non-symmetric systems. It is often preferred for the sake of itsstability. We present TPILU(k), the first efficiently parallelized ILU(k)preconditioner that maintains this important stability property. Even better,TPILU(k) preconditioning produces an answer that is bit-compatible with thesequential ILU(k) preconditioning. In terms of performance, the TPILU(k)preconditioning is shown to run faster whenever more cores are made availableto it --- while continuing to be as stable as sequential ILU(k). This is incontrast to some competing methods that may become unstable if the degree ofthread parallelism is raised too far. Where Block Jacobi ILU(k) fails in anapplication, it can be replaced by TPILU(k) in order to maintain goodperformance, while also achieving full stability. As a further optimization,TPILU(k) offers an optional level-based incomplete inverse method as a fastapproximation for the original ILU(k) preconditioned matrix. Although thisenhancement is not bit-compatible with classical ILU(k), it is bit-compatiblewith the output from the single-threaded version of the same algorithm. Inexperiments on a 16-core computer, the enhanced TPILU(k)-based iterative linearsolver performed up to 9 times faster. As we approach an era of many-corecomputing, the ability to efficiently take advantage of many cores will becomeever more important. TPILU(k) also demonstrates good performance on cluster orGrid. For example, the new algorithm achieves 50 times speedup with 80 nodesfor general sparse matrices of dimension 160,000 that are diagonally dominant.	cs.DC

However, there are certainfloating challenges unresolved in the analysis and detection of abnormalperformances of cardiovascular system. As the medical field is moving towardsmore automated and intelligent systems, wrong detection or wronginterpretations of ECG waveform of abnormal conditions can be quite fatal.Since the PQRST signals vary their positions randomly, the process of locating,identifying and classifying each feature can be cumbersome and it is prone toerrors. Here we present an automated scheme using adaptive wavelet to detectprominent R-peak with extreme accuracy and algorithmically tag and mark thecoexisting peaks P, Q, S, and T with almost same accuracy. The adaptive waveletapproach used in this scheme is capable of detecting R-peak in ECG with 99.99%accuracy along with the rest of the waveforms.	cs.CV
train_45511	Active Estimation of 3D Lines in Spherical Coordinates	  Straight lines are common features in human made environments, which makesthem a frequently explored feature for control applications. Many controlschemes, like Visual Servoing, require the 3D parameters of the features to beestimated. In order to obtain the 3D structure of lines, a nonlinear observeris proposed. However, to guarantee convergence, the dynamical system must becoupled with an algebraic equation. This is achieved by using sphericalcoordinates to represent the line's moment vector, and a change of basis, whichallows to introduce the algebraic constraint directly on the system's dynamics.Finally, a control law that attempts to optimize the convergence behavior ofthe observer is presented. The approach is validated in simulation, and with areal robotic platform with a camera onboard.	cs.RO

A star is a pair $(f, C_f)$ where $f \in F$ and $C_f \subseteqC$, and the load of a star is $\sum_{c \in C_f} d(f, c)$. In minimum load$k$-star cover problem $(\mathrm{MLkSC})$, one tries to cover the set ofclients $C$ using $k$ stars that minimize the maximum load of a star, and inminimum size star cover $(\mathrm{MSSC})$ one aims to find the minimum numberof stars of load at most $T$ needed to cover $C$, where $T$ is a givenparameter.  We obtain new bicriteria approximations for the two problems using novelrounding algorithms for their standard LP relaxations. For $\mathrm{MLkSC}$, wefind a star cover with $(1+\varepsilon)k$ stars and$O(1/\varepsilon^2)\mathrm{OPT}_{\mathrm{MLk}}$ load where$\mathrm{OPT}_{\mathrm{MLk}}$ is the optimum load. For $\mathrm{MSSC}$, we finda star cover with $O(1/\varepsilon^2) \mathrm{OPT}_{\mathrm{MS}}$ stars of loadat most $(2 + \varepsilon) T$ where $\mathrm{OPT}_{\mathrm{MS}}$ is the optimalnumber of stars for the problem. Previously, non-trivial bicriteriaapproximations were known only when $F = C$.	cs.DS
train_08662	A Game Model for Proofs with Costs	  We look at substructural calculi from a game semantic point of view, guidedby certain intuitions about resource conscious and, more specifically, costconscious reasoning. To this aim, we start with a game, where player I defendsa claim corresponding to a (single-conclusion) sequent, while player II triesto refute that claim. Branching rules for additive connectives are modeled bychoices of II, while branching for multiplicative connectives leads tosplitting the game into parallel subgames, all of which have to be won byplayer I to succeed. The game comes into full swing by adding cost labels toassumptions, and a corresponding budget. Different proofs of the sameend-sequent are interpreted as more or less expensive strategies for I todefend the corresponding claim. This leads to a new kind of labelled calculus,which can be seen as a fragment of SELL (subexponential linear logic). Finally,we generalize the concept of costs in proofs by using a semiring structure,illustrate our interpretation by examples and investigate someproof-theoretical properties.	cs.LO

For instance, Amazon providesa fine-grained score on a numeric scale for product reviews. Some sources,however, like social media (Twitter, Facebook), mailing lists (Google Groups)and forums (Quora) contain text data that is much more voluminous, butunstructured and unlabelled. It might be in the best interests of a businessestablishment to assess the general sentiment towards their brand on theseplatforms as well. This text could be pipelined into a system with a built-inprediction model, with the objective of generating real-time graphs on opinionand sentiment trends. Although such tasks like the one described about havebeen explored with respect to document classification problems in the past, theimplementation described in this paper, by virtue of learning a continuousfunction rather than a discrete one, offers a lot more depth of insight ascompared to document classification approaches. This study aims to explore thevalidity of such a continuous function predicting model to quantify sentimentabout an entity, without the additional overhead of manual labelling, andcomputational preprocessing & feature extraction. This research project alsoaims to design and implement a re-usable document regression pipeline as aframework, Rapid-Rate, that can be used to predict document scores inreal-time.	cs.CL
train_49419	On the Expressive Power of Sub-Propositional Fragments of Modal Logic	  Modal logic is a paradigm for several useful and applicable formal systems incomputer science. It generally retains the low complexity of classicalpropositional logic, but notable exceptions exist in the domains ofdescription, temporal, and spatial logic, where the most expressive formalismshave a very high complexity or are even undecidable. In search ofcomputationally well-behaved fragments, clausal forms and othersub-propositional restrictions of temporal and description logics have beenrecently studied. This renewed interest on sub-propositional logics, whichmainly focus on the complexity of the various fragments, raise naturalquestions on their the relative expressive power, which we try to answer herefor the basic multi-modal logic Kn. We consider the Horn and the Kromrestrictions, as well as the combined restriction (known as the core fragment)of modal logic, and, orthogonally, the fragments that emerge by disallowingboxes or diamonds from positive literals. We study the problem in a verygeneral setting, to ease transferring our results to other meaningful cases.	cs.LO

train_48912	Upstream Polling Protocols for Flow Control in PON/xDSL Hybrid Access  Networks	  In a hybrid PON/xDSL access network, multiple Customer Premise Equipment(CPE) nodes connect over individual Digital Subscriber Lines (DSLs) to adrop-point device. The drop-point device, which is typically reverse poweredfrom the customer, is co-located with an Optical Network Unit (ONU) of thePassive Optical Network (PON). We demonstrate that the drop-point experiencesvery high buffer occupancies when no flow control or standard Ethernet PAUSEframe flow control is employed. In order to reduce the buffer occupancies inthe drop-point, we introduce two gated flow control protocols that extend thepolling-based PON medium access control to the DSL segments between the CPEsand the ONUs. We analyze the timing of the gated flow control mechanisms tospecify the latest possible time instant when CPEs can start the DSL upstreamtransmissions so that the ONU can forward the upstream transmissions at thefull PON upstream transmission bit rate. Through extensive simulations for awide range of bursty traffic models, we find that the gated flow controlmechanisms, specifically, the ONU and CPE grant sizing policies, enableeffective control of the maximum drop-point buffer occupancies.	cs.NI
