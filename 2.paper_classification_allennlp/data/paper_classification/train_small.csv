train_07902	A novel method for fatigue testing of MEMS devices containing movable  elements	  In this paper we present an electronic circuit for position or capacitanceestimation of MEMS electrostatic actuators based on a switched capacitortechnique. The circuit uses a capacitive divider configuration composed by afixed capacitor and the variable capacitance of the electrostatic actuator forgenerating a signal that is a function of the input voltage and capacitiveratio. The proposed circuit can be used to actuate and to sense position of anelectrostatic MEMS actuator without extra sensing elements. This approach iscompatible with the requirements of most analog feedback systems and thecircuit topology of pulsed digital oscillators (PDO).	cs.OH
train_04373	Active Improvement of Control Policies with Bayesian Gaussian Mixture  Model	  Learning from demonstration (LfD) is an intuitive framework allowingnon-expert users to easily (re-)program robots. However, the quality andquantity of demonstrations have a great influence on the generalizationperformances of LfD approaches. In this paper, we introduce a novel activelearning framework in order to improve the generalization capabilities ofcontrol policies. The proposed approach is based on the epistemic uncertaintiesof Bayesian Gaussian mixture models (BGMMs). We determine the new query pointlocation by optimizing a closed-form information-density cost based on thequadratic R\'enyi entropy. Furthermore, to better represent uncertain regionsand to avoid local optima problem, we propose to approximate the activelearning cost with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). We demonstrate our activelearning framework in the context of a reaching task in a cluttered environmentwith an illustrative toy example and a real experiment with a Panda robot.	cs.RO
train_01315	Reference-Aware Language Models	  We propose a general class of language models that treat reference as anexplicit stochastic latent variable. This architecture allows models to creatementions of entities and their attributes by accessing external databases(required by, e.g., dialogue generation and recipe generation) and internalstate (required by, e.g. language models which are aware of coreference). Thisfacilitates the incorporation of information that can be accessed inpredictable locations in databases or discourse context, even when the targetsof the reference may be rare words. Experiments on three tasks shows our modelvariants based on deterministic attention.	cs.CL

We provide examples for how asemantically-informed AI system can exploit the precise, numerical informationprovided by a game engine to perform qualitative reasoning about objects andevents, facilitate learning novel concepts from data, and communicate with ahuman to improve its models and demonstrate its understanding. We argue thatsimulation environments, and game engines in particular, bring together manydifferent notions of "simulation" and many different technologies to provide ahighly-effective platform for developing both AI systems and tools toexperiment in both machine and human intelligence.	cs.AI
train_10880	Ethically Aligned Opportunistic Scheduling for Productive Laziness	  In artificial intelligence (AI) mediated workforce management systems (e.g.,crowdsourcing), long-term success depends on workers accomplishing tasksproductively and resting well. This dual objective can be summarized by theconcept of productive laziness. Existing scheduling approaches mostly focus onefficiency but overlook worker wellbeing through proper rest. In order toenable workforce management systems to follow the IEEE Ethically Aligned Designguidelines to prioritize worker wellbeing, we propose a distributedComputational Productive Laziness (CPL) approach in this paper. Itintelligently recommends personalized work-rest schedules based on local dataconcerning a worker's capabilities and situational factors to incorporateopportunistic resting and achieve superlinear collective productivity withoutthe need for explicit coordination messages. Extensive experiments based on areal-world dataset of over 5,000 workers demonstrate that CPL enables workersto spend 70% of the effort to complete 90% of the tasks on average, providingmore ethically aligned scheduling than existing approaches.	cs.AI
train_29354	Lambda-Field: A Continuous Counterpart Of The Bayesian Occupancy Grid  For Risk Assessment And Safe Navigation	  In the context of autonomous robots, one of the most important tasks is toprevent potential damages on the robot during navigation. For this purpose, itis often assumed to deal with known probabilistic obstacles, then to computethe probability of collision to each obstacle. However, in complex scenarios orunstructured environments, it might be difficult to detect such obstacles. Inthis case, a metric map is used where each position stores the information ofoccupancy. The most common type of metric map is the bayesian occupancy map.However, this type of map is not well fitted to compute risk assessment forcontinuous paths due to its discrete nature. Hence, we introduce a novel typeof map called Lambda-Field, specially designed for risk assessment. We firstpropose a way to compute such a map and the expectancy of a generic risk over apath. Then, we demonstrate the utility of our generic formulation with a usecase defining the risk as the expected force of collision over a path. Usingthis risk definition and the Lambda-Field, we show that our framework iscapable of doing classical path planning while having a physical-based metric.Furthermore, the Lambda-Field gives a natural way to deal with unstructuredenvironments like tall grass. Where standard environment representations wouldgenerate trajectories going around such obstacles, our framework allows therobot to go through the grass while being aware of the risk taken.	cs.RO
train_00184	RePose: Learning Deep Kinematic Priors for Fast Human Pose Estimation	  We propose a novel efficient and lightweight model for human pose estimationfrom a single image. Our model is designed to achieve competitive results at afraction of the number of parameters and computational cost of variousstate-of-the-art methods. To this end, we explicitly incorporate part-basedstructural and geometric priors in a hierarchical prediction framework. At thecoarsest resolution, and in a manner similar to classical part-basedapproaches, we leverage the kinematic structure of the human body to propagateconvolutional feature updates between the keypoints or body parts. Unlikeclassical approaches, we adopt end-to-end training to learn this geometricprior through feature updates from data. We then propagate the featurerepresentation at the coarsest resolution up the hierarchy to refine thepredicted pose in a coarse-to-fine fashion. The final network effectivelymodels the geometric prior and intuition within a lightweight deep neuralnetwork, yielding state-of-the-art results for a model of this size on twostandard datasets, Leeds Sports Pose and MPII Human Pose.	cs.CV
train_13445	MetaFusion: Controlled False-Negative Reduction of Minority Classes in  Semantic Segmentation	  In semantic segmentation datasets, classes of high importance are oftentimesunderrepresented, e.g., humans in street scenes. Neural networks are usuallytrained to reduce the overall number of errors, attaching identical loss toerrors of all kinds. However, this is not necessarily aligned with humanintuition. For instance, an overlooked pedestrian seems more severe than anincorrectly detected one. One possible remedy is to deploy different decisionrules by introducing class priors which assigns larger weight tounderrepresented classes. While reducing the false-negatives of theunderrepresented class, at the same time this leads to a considerable increaseof false-positive indications. In this work, we combine decision rules withmethods for false-positive detection. We therefore fuse false-negativedetection with uncertainty based false-positive meta classification. We presentproof-of-concept results for CIFAR-10, and prove the efficiency of our methodfor the semantic segmentation of street scenes on the Cityscapes dataset basedon predicted instances of the 'human' class. In the latter we employ anadvanced false-positive detection method using uncertainty measures aggregatedover instances. We thereby achieve improved trade-offs between false-negativeand false-positive samples of the underrepresented classes.	cs.CV

However, despite its widespread adoption, the evidential value ofobtained findings in court is still largely unclear. In this paper, we focus onthe key ingredients of modern cryptocurrency analytics techniques, which areclustering heuristics and attribution tags. We identify internationallyaccepted standards and rules for substantiating suspicions and providingevidence in court and project them onto current cryptocurrency forensicspractices. By providing an empirical analysis of CoinJoin transactions, weillustrate possible sources of misinterpretation in algorithmic clusteringheuristics. Eventually, we derive a set of legal key requirements and translatethem into a technical data sharing framework that fosters compliance withexisting legal and technical standards in the realm of cryptocurrencyforensics.

train_23017	An Aggregation-Based Overall Quality Measurement for Visualization	  Aesthetics are often used to evaluate the quality of graph drawings. However,the existing aesthetic criteria are useful in judging the extents to which adrawing conforms to particular drawing rules. They have limitations inevaluating overall quality. Currently the overall quality of graph drawings ismainly evaluated based on personal judgments and user studies. Personaljudgments are not reliable, while user studies can be costly to run. Therefore,there is a need for a direct measure of overall quality. This measure can beused by visualization designers to quickly compare the quality of drawings athand at the design stage and make decisions accordingly. In an attempt to meetthis need, we propose a measure that measures overall quality based onaggregation of individual aesthetic criteria. We present a user study thatvalidates this measure and demonstrates its capacity in predicting theperformance of human graph comprehension. The implications of the proposedmeasure for future research are discussed.	cs.HC
train_15552	Robot Learning of Shifting Objects for Grasping in Cluttered  Environments	  Robotic grasping in cluttered environments is often infeasible due toobstacles preventing possible grasps. Then, pre-grasping manipulation likeshifting or pushing an object becomes necessary. We developed an algorithm thatcan learn, in addition to grasping, to shift objects in such a way that theirgrasp probability increases. Our research contribution is threefold: First, wepresent an algorithm for learning the optimal pose of manipulation primitiveslike clamping or shifting. Second, we learn non-prehensible actions thatexplicitly increase the grasping probability. Making one skill (shifting)directly dependent on another (grasping) removes the need of sparse rewards,leading to more data-efficient learning. Third, we apply a real-world solutionto the industrial task of bin picking, resulting in the ability to empty binscompletely. The system is trained in a self-supervised manner with around 25000grasp and 2500 shift actions. Our robot is able to grasp and file objects with274 picks per hour. Furthermore, we demonstrate the system's ability togeneralize to novel objects.	cs.RO
train_37538	Large neighborhoods with implicit customer selection for vehicle routing  problems with profits	  We consider several Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) with profits, which seekto select a subset of customers, each one being associated with a profit, andto design service itineraries. When the sum of profits is maximized underdistance constraints, the problem is usually called team orienteering problem.The capacitated profitable tour problem seeks to maximize profits minus travelcosts under capacity constraints. Finally, in the VRP with private fleet andcommon carrier, some customers can be delegated to an external carrier subjectto a cost. Three families of combined decisions must be taken: customersselection, assignment to vehicles, and sequencing of deliveries for each route.  We propose a new neighborhood search for these problems which explores anexponential number of solutions in pseudo polynomial time. The search isconducted with standard VRP neighborhoods on an "exhaustive" solutionrepresentation, visiting all customers. Since visiting all customers is usuallyinfeasible or sub-optimal, an efficient "Select" algorithm, based on resourceconstrained shortest paths, is repeatedly used on any new route to find theoptimal subsequence of visits to customers. The good performance of theseneighborhood structures is demonstrated by extensive computational experimentswith a local search, an iterated local search and a hybrid genetic algorithm.Intriguingly, even a local-improvement method to the first local optimum ofthis neighborhood achieves an average gap of 0.09% on classic team orienteeringbenchmark instances, rivaling with the current state-of-the-art metaheuristics.Promising research avenues on hybridizations with more standard routingneighborhoods are also open.	cs.DS

A theoretical study and experimentalresults demonstrate the efficiency of our index, even when queries are complex.	cs.DB
train_04216	A lower bound on the performance of dynamic curing policies for  epidemics on graphs	  We consider an SIS-type epidemic process that evolves on a known graph. Weassume that a fixed curing budget can be allocated at each instant to the nodesof the graph, towards the objective of minimizing the expected extinction timeof the epidemic. We provide a lower bound on the optimal expected extinctiontime as a function of the available budget, the epidemic parameters, themaximum degree, and the CutWidth of the graph. For graphs with large CutWidth(close to the largest possible), and under a budget which is sublinear in thenumber of nodes, our lower bound scales exponentially with the size of thegraph.	cs.SI
train_32946	Robust Control of the Sit-to-Stand Movement for a Powered Lower Limb  Orthosis	  The sit-to-stand movement is a key feature for wide adoption of powered lowerlimb orthoses for patients with complete paraplegia. In this paper we study thecontrol of the ascending phase of the sit-to-stand movement for a minimallyactuated powered lower limb orthosis at the hips. First, we generate a pool offinite horizon Linear Quadratic Regulator feedback gains, designed under theassumption that we can control not only the torque at the hips but also theloads at the shoulders that in reality are applied by the user. Next we conductreachability analysis to define a performance metric measuring the robustnessof each controller against parameter uncertainty, and choose the bestcontroller from the pool with respect to this metric. Then, we replace thepresumed shoulder control with an Iterative Learning Control algorithm as asubstitute for human experiments. Indeed this algorithm obtains torque andforces at the shoulders that result in successful simulations of thesit-to-stand movement, regardless of parameter uncertainty and factorsdeliberately introduced to hinder learning. Thus it is reasonable to expectthat the superior cognitive skills of real users will enable them to cooperatewith the hip torque controller through training.	cs.SY
train_14846	Interactive Overlays of Journals and the Measurement of  Interdisciplinarity on the basis of Aggregated Journal-Journal Citations	  Using "Analyze Results" at the Web of Science, one can directly generateoverlays onto global journal maps of science. The maps are based on the 10,000+journals contained in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) of the Science andSocial Science Citation Indices (2011). The disciplinary diversity of theretrieval is measured in terms of Rao-Stirling's "quadratic entropy." Sincethis indicator of interdisciplinarity is normalized between zero and one, theinterdisciplinarity can be compared among document sets and across years, citedor citing. The colors used for the overlays are based on Blondel et al.'s(2008) community-finding algorithms operating on the relations journalsincluded in JCRs. The results can be exported from VOSViewer with differentoptions such as proportional labels, heat maps, or cluster density maps. Themaps can also be web-started and/or animated (e.g., using PowerPoint). The"citing" dimension of the aggregated journal-journal citation matrix was foundto provide a more comprehensive description than the matrix based on the citedarchive. The relations between local and global maps and their differentfunctions in studying the sciences in terms of journal litteratures are furtherdiscussed: local and global maps are based on different assumptions and can beexpected to serve different purposes for the explanation.	cs.DL
train_44398	On the approximation guarantee of obviously strategyproof mechanisms	  Catering to the incentives of people with limited rationality is achallenging research direction that requires novel paradigms to designmechanisms and approximation algorithms. Obviously strategyproof (OSP)mechanisms have recently emerged as the concept of interest to this researchagenda. However, the majority of the literature in the area has eitherhighlighted the shortcomings of OSP or focused on the "right" definition ratherthan on the construction of these mechanisms.  We here give the first set of tight results on the approximation guarantee ofOSP mechanisms for scheduling related machines and a characterization ofoptimal OSP mechanisms for set system problems. By extending the well-knowncycle monotonicity technique, we are able to concentrate on the algorithmiccomponent of OSP mechanisms and provide some novel paradigms for their design.	cs.GT

We propose a dynamical model based on linear mixingprocesses at each time instant. The spectral signatures and fractionalabundances of the pure materials in the scene are seen as latent variables, andassumed to follow a general dynamical structure. Based on a simplified versionof this model, we derive an efficient spectral unmixing algorithm to estimatethe latent variables by performing alternating minimizations. The performanceof the proposed approach is demonstrated on synthetic and real multitemporalhyperspectral images.	cs.CV
train_23077	Elastic Pathing: Your Speed is Enough to Track You	  Today people increasingly have the opportunity to opt-in to "usage-based"automotive insurance programs for reducing insurance premiums. In theseprograms, participants install devices in their vehicles that monitor theirdriving behavior, which raises some privacy concerns. Some devices collectfine-grained speed data to monitor driving habits. Companies that use thesedevices claim that their approach is privacy-preserving because speedometermeasurements do not have physical locations. However, we show that withknowledge of the user's home location, as the insurance companies have, speeddata is sufficient to discover driving routes and destinations when trip datais collected over a period of weeks. To demonstrate the real-worldapplicability of our approach we applied our algorithm, elastic pathing, todata collected over hundreds of driving trips occurring over several months.With this data and our approach, we were able to predict trip destinations towithin 250 meters of ground truth in 10% of the traces and within 500 meters in20% of the traces. This result, combined with the amount of speed data that isbeing collected by insurance companies, constitutes a substantial breach ofprivacy because a person's regular driving pattern can be deduced with repeatedexamples of the same paths with just a few weeks of monitoring.	cs.CR
train_06305	Deep Temporal Analysis for Non-Acted Body Affect Recognition	  Affective computing is a field of great interest in many computer visionapplications, including video surveillance, behaviour analysis, and human-robotinteraction. Most of the existing literature has addressed this field byanalysing different sets of face features. However, in the last decade, severalstudies have shown how body movements can play a key role even in emotionrecognition. The majority of these experiments on the body are performed bytrained actors whose aim is to simulate emotional reactions. These unnaturalexpressions differ from the more challenging genuine emotions, thusinvalidating the obtained results. In this paper, a solution for basicnon-acted emotion recognition based on 3D skeleton and Deep Neural Networks(DNNs) is provided. The proposed work introduces three majors contributions.First, unlike the current state-of-the-art in non-acted body affectrecognition, where only static or global body features are considered, in thiswork also temporal local movements performed by subjects in each frame areexamined. Second, an original set of global and time-dependent features forbody movement description is provided. Third, to the best of out knowledge,this is the first attempt to use deep learning methods for non-acted bodyaffect recognition. Due to the novelty of the topic, only the UCLIC dataset iscurrently considered the benchmark for comparative tests. On the latter, theproposed method outperforms all the competitors.	cs.CV
train_47163	Simple Mechanisms for Profit Maximization in Multi-item Auctions	  We study a classical Bayesian mechanism design problem where a seller isselling multiple items to multiple buyers. We consider the case where theseller has costs to produce the items, and these costs are private informationto the seller. How can the seller design a mechanism to maximize her profit?Two well-studied problems, revenue maximization in multi-item auctions andsignaling in ad auctions, are special cases of our problem. We show that thereexists a simple mechanism whose profit is at least $\frac{1}{44}$ of theoptimal profit for multiple buyers with matroid-rank valuation functions. Whenthere is a single buyer, the approximation factor is $11$ for generalconstraint-additive valuations and $6$ for additive valuations. Our resultholds even when the seller's costs are correlated across items.  We introduce a new class of mechanisms called permit-selling mechanisms. Forsingle buyer case these mechanisms are quite simple: there are two stages. Foreach item $j$, we create a separate permit that allows the buyer to purchasethe item in the second stage. In the first stage, we sell the permits withoutrevealing any information about the costs. In the second stage, the sellerreveals all the costs, and the buyer can buy item $j$ by paying the item priceif the buyer has purchased the permit for item $j$ in the first stage. We showthat either selling the permits separately or as a grand bundle suffices toachieve the constant factor approximation to the optimal profit (6 foradditive, and 11 for constrained additive). For multiple buyers, we sell thepermits sequentially and obtain the constant factor approximation. Our proof isenabled by constructing a benchmark for the optimal profit by combining a noveldual solution with the existing ex-ante relaxation technique.	cs.GT
train_31306	URSA: A Neural Network for Unordered Point Clouds Using Constellations	  This paper describes a neural network layer, named Ursa, that uses aconstellation of points to learn classification information from point clouddata. Unlike other machine learning classification problems where the task isto classify an individual high-dimensional observation, in a point-cloudclassification problem the goal is to classify a set of d-dimensionalobservations. Because a point cloud is a set, there is no ordering to thecollection of points in a point-cloud classification problem. Thus, thechallenge of classifying point clouds inputs is in building a classifier whichis agnostic to the ordering of the observations, yet preserves thed-dimensional information of each point in the set. This research presentsUrsa, a new layer type for an artificial neural network which achieves thesetwo properties. Similar to new methods for this task, this architecture worksdirectly on d-dimensional points rather than first converting the points to ad-dimensional volume. The Ursa layer is followed by a series of dense layers toclassify 2D and 3D objects from point clouds. Experiments on ModelNet40 andMNIST data show classification results comparable with current methods, whilereducing the training parameters by over 50 percent.	cs.CV

Here, we focus onrecognition task where images are provided as the main view and soft biometrictraits (attributes) are provided as the privileged data (only available duringtraining phase). We demonstrate that more discriminative feature space can belearned by enforcing a deep network to adjust adaptive margins between classesutilizing attributes. This tight constraint also effectively reduces the classimbalance inherent in the local data neighborhood, thus carving more balancedclass boundaries locally and using feature space more efficiently. Extensiveexperiments are performed on five different datasets and the results show thesuperiority of our method compared to the state-of-the-art models in both tasksof face recognition and person re-identification.	cs.CV
train_46927	Effective Training of Convolutional Neural Networks with Low-bitwidth  Weights and Activations	  This paper tackles the problem of training a deep convolutional neuralnetwork of both low-bitwidth weights and activations. Optimizing alow-precision network is very challenging due to the non-differentiability ofthe quantizer, which may result in substantial accuracy loss. To address this,we propose three practical approaches, including (i) progressive quantization;(ii) stochastic precision; and (iii) joint knowledge distillation to improvethe network training. First, for progressive quantization, we propose twoschemes to progressively find good local minima. Specifically, we propose tofirst optimize a net with quantized weights and subsequently quantizeactivations. This is in contrast to the traditional methods which optimize themsimultaneously. Furthermore, we propose a second progressive quantizationscheme which gradually decreases the bit-width from high-precision tolow-precision during training. Second, to alleviate the excessive trainingburden due to the multi-round training stages, we further propose a one-stagestochastic precision strategy to randomly sample and quantize sub-networkswhile keeping other parts in full-precision. Finally, we adopt a novel learningscheme to jointly train a full-precision model alongside the low-precision one.By doing so, the full-precision model provides hints to guide the low-precisionmodel training and significantly improves the performance of the low-precisionnetwork. Extensive experiments on various datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, ImageNet)show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.	cs.CV

train_10149	Integrating existing cone-shaped and projection-based cardinal direction  relations and a TCSP-like decidable generalisation	  We consider the integration of existing cone-shaped and projection-basedcalculi of cardinal direction relations, well-known in QSR. The more general,integrating language we consider is based on convex constraints of thequalitative form $r(x,y)$, $r$ being a cone-shaped or projection-based cardinaldirection atomic relation, or of the quantitative form $(\alpha ,\beta)(x,y)$,with $\alpha ,\beta\in [0,2\pi)$ and $(\beta -\alpha)\in [0,\pi ]$: the meaningof the quantitative constraint, in particular, is that point $x$ belongs to the(convex) cone-shaped area rooted at $y$, and bounded by angles $\alpha$ and$\beta$. The general form of a constraint is a disjunction of the form$[r_1\vee...\vee r_{n_1}\vee (\alpha_1,\beta_1)\vee...\vee (\alpha_{n_2},\beta_{n_2})](x,y)$, with $r_i(x,y)$, $i=1... n_1$, and $(\alpha_i,\beta_i)(x,y)$, $i=1... n_2$, being convex constraints as described above:the meaning of such a general constraint is that, for some $i=1... n_1$,$r_i(x,y)$ holds, or, for some $i=1... n_2$, $(\alpha_i,\beta_i)(x,y)$ holds. Aconjunction of such general constraints is a $\tcsp$-like CSP, which we willrefer to as an $\scsp$ (Spatial Constraint Satisfaction Problem). An effectivesolution search algorithm for an $\scsp$ will be described, which uses (1)constraint propagation, based on a composition operation to be defined, as thefiltering method during the search, and (2) the Simplex algorithm, guaranteeingcompleteness, at the leaves of the search tree. The approach is particularlysuited for large-scale high-level vision, such as, e.g., satellite-likesurveillance of a geographic area.	cs.AI

Our mainresult is a sublinear algorithm with the running time$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n}\cdot\mathrm{poly}(\phi,k,1/\varepsilon))$ that takes asinput a graph with maximum degree bounded by $d$, parameters $k$, $\phi$,$\varepsilon$, and with probability at least $\frac23$, accepts the graph if itis $(k,\phi)$-clusterable and rejects the graph if it is $\varepsilon$-far from$(k, \phi^*)$-clusterable for $\phi^* = c'_{d,k}\frac{\phi^2\varepsilon^4}{\log n}$, where $c'_{d,k}$ depends only on $d,k$. By the lowerbound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ on the number of queries needed for testing graphexpansion, which corresponds to $k=1$ in our problem, our algorithm isasymptotically optimal up to polylogarithmic factors.	cs.DS

Given the corpus-levelstatistics, i.e., a global co-occurrence graph of a clinical text corpus, topredict the relations between two entities, we first recall rich contextsassociated with the target entities, and then recognize relational interactionsbetween these contexts to form model rationales, which will contribute to thefinal prediction. We conduct experiments on a real-world public clinicaldataset and show that our framework can not only achieve competitive predictiveperformance against a comprehensive list of neural baseline models, but alsopresent rationales to justify its prediction. We further collaborate withmedical experts deeply to verify the usefulness of our model rationales forclinical decision making.	cs.CL

The observation motivates anew method for finding faces through scoring facial parts responses by theirspatial structure and arrangement. The scoring mechanism is data-driven, andcarefully formulated considering challenging cases where faces are onlypartially visible. This consideration allows our network to detect faces undersevere occlusion and unconstrained pose variations. Our method achievespromising performance on popular benchmarks including FDDB, PASCAL Faces, AFW,and WIDER FACE.	cs.CV
train_11965	Learning Efficient Tensor Representations with Ring Structure Networks	  Tensor train (TT) decomposition is a powerful representation for high-ordertensors, which has been successfully applied to various machine learning tasksin recent years. However, since the tensor product is not commutative,permutation of data dimensions makes solutions and TT-ranks of TT decompositioninconsistent. To alleviate this problem, we propose a permutation symmetricnetwork structure by employing circular multilinear products over a sequence oflow-order core tensors. This network structure can be graphically interpretedas a cyclic interconnection of tensors, and thus we call it tensor ring (TR)representation. We develop several efficient algorithms to learn TRrepresentation with adaptive TR-ranks by employing low-rank approximations.Furthermore, mathematical properties are investigated, which enables us toperform basic operations in a computationally efficiently way by using TRrepresentations. Experimental results on synthetic signals and real-worlddatasets demonstrate that the proposed TR network is more expressive andconsistently informative than existing TT networks.	cs.NA
train_11950	Transferring Interactive Search-Based Software Testing to Industry	  Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) is the application of optimizationalgorithms to problems in software testing. In previous work, we haveimplemented and evaluated Interactive Search-Based Software Testing (ISBST)tool prototypes, with a goal to successfully transfer the technique toindustry. While SBSE solutions are often validated on benchmark problems, thereis a need to validate them in an operational setting. The present paperdiscusses the development and deployment of SBST tools for use in industry andreflects on the transfer of these techniques to industry. In addition toprevious work discussing the development and validation of an ISBST prototype,a new version of the prototype ISBST system was evaluated in the laboratory andin industry. This evaluation is based on an industrial System under Test (SUT)and was carried out with industrial practitioners. The Technology TransferModel is used as a framework to describe the progression of the development andevaluation of the ISBST system. The paper presents a synthesis of previous workdeveloping and evaluating the ISBST prototype, as well as presenting anevaluation, in both academia and industry, of that prototype's latest version.This paper presents an overview of the development and deployment of the ISBSTsystem in an industrial setting, using the framework of the Technology TransferModel. We conclude that the ISBST system is capable of evolving useful testcases for that setting, though improvements in the means the system uses tocommunicate that information to the user are still required. In addition, a setof lessons learned from the project are listed and discussed. Our objective isto help other researchers that wish to validate search-based systems inindustry and provide more information about the benefits and drawbacks of thesesystems.	cs.SE
train_32667	Complexity of the path avoiding forbidden pairs problem revisited	  Let G = (V, E) be a directed acyclic graph with two distinguished vertices s,t and let F be a set of forbidden pairs of vertices. We say that a path in G issafe, if it contains at most one vertex from each pair {u, v} in F. Given G andF, the path avoiding forbidden pairs (PAFP) problem is to find a safe s-t pathin G. We systematically study the complexity of different special cases of thePAFP problem defined according to the mutual positions of forbidden pairs. Fixone topological ordering of vertices; we say that pairs {u, v} and {x, y} aredisjoint, if u, v < x, y, nested, if u < x, y < v, and halving, if u < x < v <y. The PAFP problem is known to be NP-hard in general or if no two pairs aredisjoint; we prove that it remains NP-hard even when no two forbidden pairs arenested. On the other hand, if no two pairs are halving, the problem is known tobe solvable in cubic time. We simplify and improve this result by showing anO(M(n)) time algorithm, where M(n) is the time to multiply two n \times nboolean matrices.	cs.DM
train_02777	Personal Information Ecosystems and Implications for Design	  Today, people use multiple devices to fulfill their information needs.However, designers design each device individually, without accounting for theother devices that users may also use. In many cases, the applications on allthese devices are designed to be functional replicates of each other. We arguethat this results in an over-reliance on data synchronization across devices,version control nightmares, and increased burden of file management. In thispaper, we present the idea of a \textit{personal information ecosystem}, ananalogy to biological ecosystems, which allows us to discuss theinter-relationships among these devices to fulfill the information needs of theuser. There is a need for designers to design devices as part of a completeecosystem, not as independent devices that simply share data replicated acrossthem. To help us understand this domain and to facilitate the dialogue andstudy of such systems, we present the terminology, classifications of theinterdependencies among different devices, and resulting implications fordesign.	cs.HC
train_37256	Towards a First Step to Understand the Cryptocurrency Stealing Attack on  Ethereum	  We performed the first systematic study of a new attack on Ethereum thatsteals cryptocurrencies. The attack is due to the unprotected JSON-RPCendpoints existed in Ethereum nodes that could be exploited by attackers totransfer the Ether and ERC20 tokens to attackers-controlled accounts. Thisstudy aims to shed light on the attack, including malicious behaviors andprofits of attackers. Specifically, we first designed and implemented ahoneypot that could capture real attacks in the wild. We then deployed thehoneypot and reported results of the collected data in a period of six months.In total, our system captured more than 308 million requests from 1,072distinct IP addresses. We further grouped attackers into 36 groups with 59distinct Ethereum accounts. Among them, attackers of 34 groups were stealingthe Ether, while other 2 groups were targeting ERC20 tokens. The furtherbehavior analysis showed that attackers were following a three-steps pattern tosteal the Ether. Moreover, we observed an interesting type of transactioncalled zero gas transaction, which has been leveraged by attackers to stealERC20 tokens. At last, we estimated the overall profits of attackers. To engagethe whole community, the dataset of captured attacks is released onhttps://github.com/zjuicsr/eth-honey.	cs.CR

KNN-joinsfind the KNN of all points in a dataset. This paper focuses on a hybrid CPU/GPUapproach for low-dimensional KNN-joins, where the GPU may not yield substantialperformance gains over parallel CPU algorithms. We utilize a work queue thatprioritizes computing data points in high density regions on the GPU, and lowdensity regions on the CPU, thereby taking advantage of each architecture'srelative strengths. Our approach, HybridKNN-Join, effectively augments astate-of-the-art multi-core CPU algorithm. We propose optimizations that $(i)$maximize GPU query throughput by assigning the GPU large batches of work;$(ii)$ increase workload granularity to optimize GPU utilization; and, $(iii)$limit load imbalance between CPU and GPU architectures. We compareHybridKNN-Join to one GPU and two parallel CPU reference implementations.Compared to the reference implementations, we find that the hybrid algorithmperforms best on larger workloads (dataset size and K). The methods employed inthis paper show promise for the general division of work in other hybridalgorithms.	cs.DC
train_39378	Distributed backbone structure for deterministic algorithms in the SINR  model of wireless networks	  The Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise-Ratio (SINR) physical model is one ofthe legitimate models of wireless networks. Despite of the vast amount of studydone in design and analysis of centralized algorithms supporting wirelesscommunication under the SINR physical model, little is known about distributedalgorithms in this model, especially deterministic ones. In this work weconstruct, in a deterministic distributed way, a backbone structure on the topof a given wireless network, which can be used for transforming many algorithmsdesigned in a simpler model of ad hoc broadcast networks without interferenceinto the SINR physical model with uniform power of stations, without increasingtheir asymptotic time complexity. The time cost of the backbone data structureconstruction is only O(Delta polylog n) rounds, where Delta is roughly theinverse of network density and n is the number of nodes in the whole network.The core of the construction is a novel combinatorial structure calledSINR-selector, which is introduced and constructed in this paper. Wedemonstrate the power of the backbone data structure by using it for obtainingefficient O(D+Delta polylog n)-round and O(D+k+Delta polylog n)-rounddeterministic distributed solutions for leader election and multi-broadcast,respectively, where D is the network diameter and k is the number of messagesto be disseminated.	cs.DC
train_31940	Performance Evaluation of TCP over Mobile Ad hoc Networks	  With the proliferation of mobile computing devices, the demand for continuousnetwork connectivity regardless of physical location has spurred interest inthe use of mobile ad hoc networks. Since Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) isthe standard network protocol for communication in the internet, any wirelessnetwork with Internet service need to be compatible with TCP. TCP is tuned toperform well in traditional wired networks, where packet losses occur mostlybecause of congestion. However, TCP connections in Ad-hoc mobile networks areplagued by problems such as high bit error rates, frequent route changes,multipath routing and temporary network partitions. The throughput of TCP oversuch connection is not satisfactory, because TCP misinterprets the packet lossor delay as congestion and invokes congestion control and avoidance algorithm.In this research, the performance of TCP in Adhoc mobile network with high BitError rate (BER) and mobility is studied and investigated. Simulation model isimplemented and experiments are performed using the Network Simulatior 2 (NS2).	cs.NI

train_05093	Keyword-based Query Comprehending via Multiple Optimized-Demand  Augmentation	  In this paper, we consider the problem of machine reading task when thequestions are in the form of keywords, rather than natural language. In recentyears, researchers have achieved significant success on machine readingcomprehension tasks, such as SQuAD and TriviaQA. These datasets provide anatural language question sentence and a pre-selected passage, and the goal isto answer the question according to the passage. However, in the situation ofinteracting with machines by means of text, people are more likely to raise aquery in form of several keywords rather than a complete sentence. Thekeyword-based query comprehension is a new challenge, because small variationsto a question may completely change its semantical information, thus yielddifferent answers. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network system thatconsists a Demand Optimization Model based on a passage-attention neuralmachine translation and a Reader Model that can find the answer given theoptimized question. The Demand Optimization Model optimizes the original queryand output multiple reconstructed questions, then the Reader Model takes thenew questions as input and locate the answers from the passage. To makepredictions robust, an evaluation mechanism will score the reconstructedquestions so the final answer strike a good balance between the quality of boththe Demand Optimization Model and the Reader Model. Experimental results onseveral datasets show that our framework significantly improves multiple strongbaselines on this challenging task.	cs.CL

train_13897	An {\alpha}-Matte Boundary Defocus Model Based Cascaded Network for  Multi-focus Image Fusion	  Capturing an all-in-focus image with a single camera is difficult since thedepth of field of the camera is usually limited. An alternative method toobtain the all-in-focus image is to fuse several images focusing at differentdepths. However, existing multi-focus image fusion methods cannot obtain clearresults for areas near the focused/defocused boundary (FDB). In this paper, anovel {\alpha}-matte boundary defocus model is proposed to generate realistictraining data with the defocus spread effect precisely modeled, especially forareas near the FDB. Based on this {\alpha}-matte defocus model and thegenerated data, a cascaded boundary aware convolutional network termed MMF-Netis proposed and trained, aiming to achieve clearer fusion results around theFDB. More specifically, the MMF-Net consists of two cascaded sub-nets forinitial fusion and boundary fusion, respectively; these two sub-nets aredesigned to first obtain a guidance map of FDB and then refine the fusion nearthe FDB. Experiments demonstrate that with the help of the new {\alpha}-matteboundary defocus model, the proposed MMF-Net outperforms the state-of-the-artmethods both qualitatively and quantitatively.	cs.CV
train_35585	Cooperative Robust Estimation with Local Performance Guarantees	  The paper considers the problem of cooperative estimation for a linearuncertain plant observed by a network of communicating sensors. We take a novelapproach by treating the filtering problem from the view point of local sensorswhile the network interconnections are accounted for via an uncertain signalsmodelling of estimation performance of other nodes. That is, the informationcommunicated between the nodes is treated as the true plant information subjectto perturbations, and each node is endowed with certain believes about theseperturbations during the filter design. The proposed distributed filterachieves a suboptimal $H_\infty$ consensus performance. Furthermore, localperformance of each estimator is also assessed given additional constraints onthe performance of the other nodes. These conditions are shown to be useful intuning the desired estimation performance of the sensor network.	cs.SY
train_28965	Constrained Monotone Function Maximization and the Supermodular Degree	  The problem of maximizing a constrained monotone set function has manypractical applications and generalizes many combinatorial problems.Unfortunately, it is generally not possible to maximize a monotone set functionup to an acceptable approximation ratio, even subject to simple constraints.One highly studied approach to cope with this hardness is to restrict the setfunction. An outstanding disadvantage of imposing such a restriction on the setfunction is that no result is implied for set functions deviating from therestriction, even slightly. A more flexible approach, studied by Feige andIzsak, is to design an approximation algorithm whose approximation ratiodepends on the complexity of the instance, as measured by some complexitymeasure. Specifically, they introduced a complexity measure called supermodulardegree, measuring deviation from submodularity, and designed an algorithm forthe welfare maximization problem with an approximation ratio that depends onthis measure.  In this work, we give the first (to the best of our knowledge) algorithm formaximizing an arbitrary monotone set function, subject to a k-extendiblesystem. This class of constraints captures, for example, the intersection ofk-matroids (note that a single matroid constraint is sufficient to capture thewelfare maximization problem). Our approximation ratio deteriorates gracefullywith the complexity of the set function and k. Our work can be seen asgeneralizing both the classic result of Fisher, Nemhauser and Wolsey, formaximizing a submodular set function subject to a k-extendible system, and theresult of Feige and Izsak for the welfare maximization problem. Moreover, whenour algorithm is applied to each one of these simpler cases, it obtains thesame approximation ratio as of the respective original work.	cs.DS

Although this corporation shows the competitiveness in the pointcloud, it inevitably alters and abandons the 3D topology and geometricrelations. A natural remedy is to utilize the3D voxelization and 3D convolutionnetwork. However, we found that in the outdoor point cloud, the improvementobtained in this way is quite limited. An important reason is the property ofthe outdoor point cloud, namely sparsity and varying density. Motivated by thisinvestigation, we propose a new framework for the outdoor LiDAR segmentation,where cylindrical partition and asymmetrical 3D convolution networks aredesigned to explore the 3D geometric pat-tern while maintaining these inherentproperties. Moreover, a point-wise refinement module is introduced to alleviatethe interference of lossy voxel-based label encoding. We evaluate the proposedmodel on two large-scale datasets, i.e., SemanticKITTI and nuScenes. Our methodachieves the 1st place in the leaderboard of SemanticKITTI and outperformsexisting methods on nuScenes with a noticeable margin, about 4%. Furthermore,the proposed 3D framework also generalizes well to LiDAR panoptic segmentationand LiDAR 3D detection.	cs.CV

In order to reach the best possible performances, itis necessary to take into account a maximum of constraints during tool pathcalculation. For this purpose, we have developed a surface representation ofthe tool paths to manage 5-axis High Speed Milling, which is the mostcomplicated case. This model allows integrating early in the step of tool pathcomputation the machine tool geometrical constraints (axis ranges, part holderorientation), kinematical constraints (speed and acceleration on the axes,singularities) as well as gouging issues between the tool and the part. The aimof the paper is to optimize the step of 5-axis HSM tool path calculation with abi-parameter surface representation of the tool path.

train_00294	A Theory of Goal-Oriented MDPs with Dead Ends	  Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) MDPs is a problem class widely studied in AI,especially in probabilistic planning. They describe a wide range of scenariosbut make the restrictive assumption that the goal is reachable from any state,i.e., that dead-end states do not exist. Because of this, SSPs are unable tomodel various scenarios that may have catastrophic events (e.g., an airplanepossibly crashing if it flies into a storm). Even though MDP algorithms havebeen used for solving problems with dead ends, a principled theory of SSPextensions that would allow dead ends, including theoretically sound algorithmsfor solving such MDPs, has been lacking. In this paper, we propose three newMDP classes that admit dead ends under increasingly weaker assumptions. Wepresent Value Iteration-based as well as the more efficient heuristic searchalgorithms for optimally solving each class, and explore theoreticalrelationships between these classes. We also conduct a preliminary empiricalstudy comparing the performance of our algorithms on different MDP classes,especially on scenarios with unavoidable dead ends.	cs.AI

This leads to the existence of two kinds of possibilistic causalgraphs where the conditioning is either based on the minimum, or the productoperator. Benferhat et al. (1999) have investigated the connections betweenmin-based graphs and possibilistic logic bases (made of classical formulasweighted in terms of certainty). This paper deals with a more difficult issue :the product-based graphical representations of possibilistic bases, whichprovides an easy structural reading of possibilistic bases. Moreover, thispaper also provides another reading of possibilistic bases in terms ofcomparative preferences of the form "in the context p, q is preferred to notq". This enables us to explicit preferences underlying a set of goals withdifferent levels of priority.	cs.AI

train_10013	Reverse Transfer Learning: Can Word Embeddings Trained for Different NLP  Tasks Improve Neural Language Models?	  Natural language processing (NLP) tasks tend to suffer from a paucity ofsuitably annotated training data, hence the recent success of transfer learningacross a wide variety of them. The typical recipe involves: (i) training adeep, possibly bidirectional, neural network with an objective related tolanguage modeling, for which training data is plentiful; and (ii) using thetrained network to derive contextual representations that are far richer thanstandard linear word embeddings such as word2vec, and thus result in importantgains. In this work, we wonder whether the opposite perspective is also true:can contextual representations trained for different NLP tasks improve languagemodeling itself? Since language models (LMs) are predominantly locallyoptimized, other NLP tasks may help them make better predictions based on theentire semantic fabric of a document. We test the performance of several typesof pre-trained embeddings in neural LMs, and we investigate whether it ispossible to make the LM more aware of global semantic information throughembeddings pre-trained with a domain classification model. Initial experimentssuggest that as long as the proper objective criterion is used during training,pre-trained embeddings are likely to be beneficial for neural languagemodeling.	cs.CL

Many existing methods, however, discover either models that aredifficult to read, or return so many results interpretation becomes impossible.Here, we study a fully automated approach for mining easily interpretablemodels for binary data. We model data hierarchically with noisytiles-rectangles with significantly different density than their parent tile.To identify good trees, we employ the Minimum Description Length principle.  We propose STIJL, a greedy any-time algorithm for mining good tile trees frombinary data. Iteratively, it finds the locally optimal addition to the currenttree, allowing overlap with tiles of the same parent. A major result of thispaper is that we find the optimal tile in only $\Theta(NM\min(N, M))$ time.STIJL can either be employed as a top-$k$ miner, or by MDL we can identify thetree that describes the data best.  Experiments show we find succinct models that accurately summarise the data,and, by their hierarchical property are easily interpretable.	cs.DS

Examples ofHarvard-based architecture devices are the Mica family of wireless sensors.Mica motes have limited memory and can process only very small packets.Stack-based buffer overflow techniques that inject code into the stack and thenexecute it are therefore not applicable. It has been a common belief that codeinjection is impossible on Harvard architectures. This paper presents a remotecode injection attack for Mica sensors. We show how to exploit programvulnerabilities to permanently inject any piece of code into the program memoryof an Atmel AVR-based sensor. To our knowledge, this is the first result thatpresents a code injection technique for such devices. Previous work onlysucceeded in injecting data or performing transient attacks. Injectingpermanent code is more powerful since the attacker can gain full control of thetarget sensor. We also show that this attack can be used to inject a worm thatcan propagate through the wireless sensor network and possibly create a sensorbotnet. Our attack combines different techniques such as return orientedprogramming and fake stack injection. We present implementation details andsuggest some counter-measures.	cs.CR

We initially study a fixednetwork and show that the leader tracking objective is achieved semi-globallyexponentially fast if the graph contains a directed spanning tree. Bymodel-independent, we mean that each agent executes its algorithm with noknowledge of the parameter values of any agent's dynamics. Certain bounds onthe agent dynamics (including any disturbances) and network topologyinformation are used to design the control gain. This fact, combined with thealgorithm's model-independence, results in robustness to disturbances andmodelling uncertainties. Next, a continuous approximation of the algorithm isproposed, which achieves practical tracking with an adjustable tracking error.Last, we show that the algorithm is stable for networks that switch with anexplicitly computable dwell time. Numerical simulations are given to show thealgorithm's effectiveness.	cs.SY

However, existing stream-based solutions lack explicitlanguage constructs for expressing anomaly models that capture abnormal systembehaviors, thus facing challenges in incorporating expert knowledge to performtimely anomaly detection over the large-scale monitoring data. To address theselimitations, we build SAQL, a novel stream-based query system that takes asinput, a real-time event feed aggregated from multiple hosts in an enterprise,and provides an anomaly query engine that queries the event feed to identifyabnormal behaviors based on the specified anomaly models. SAQL provides adomain-specific query language, Stream-based Anomaly Query Language (SAQL),that uniquely integrates critical primitives for expressing major types ofanomaly models. In the demo, we aim to show the complete usage scenario of SAQLby (1) performing an APT attack in a controlled environment, and (2) using SAQLto detect the abnormal behaviors in real time by querying the collected streamof system monitoring data that contains the attack traces. The audience willhave the option to interact with the system and detect the attack footprints inreal time via issuing queries and checking the query results through acommand-line UI.	cs.CR
train_14904	New Lace and Arsenic: adventures in weak memory with a program logic	  We describe a program logic for weak memory (also known as relaxed memory).The logic is based on Hoare logic within a thread, and rely/guarantee betweenthreads. It is presented via examples, giving proofs of many weak-memory litmustests. It extends to coherence but not yet to synchronised assignment(compare-and-swap, load-logical/store-conditional). It deals with conditionalsand loops but not yet arrays or heap.  The logic uses a version of Hoare logic within threads, and a version ofrely/guarantee between threads, with five stability rules to handle variouskinds of parallelism (external, internal, propagation-free and two kinds ofin-flight parallelism). There are $\mathbb{B}$ and $\mathbb{U}$ modalities toregulate propagation, and temporal modalities $\mathsf{since}$,$\mathbb{S}\mathsf{ofar}$ and $\mathbb{O}\mathsf{uat}$ to deal with globalcoherence (SC per location).  The logic is presented by example. Proofs and unproofs of about thirtyweak-memory examples, including many litmus tests in various guises, are dealtwith in detail. There is a proof of a version of the token ring.  In version 2: The correspondence with Herding Cats has been clarified. Thestability rules have been simplified: in particular the sat and x= x tests havebeen eliminated from external stability checks. The embedding is simplified andhas a more transparent relation to the mechanisms of the logic. Definitions ofU, Sofar and Ouat have been considerably altered. The description of modalitiesand the treatment of termination has been reworked. Many proofs arereconstructed. A comprehensive summary of the logic is an appendix.	cs.LO
train_13531	Shape and Color Object Tracking for Real-Time Robotic Navigation	  This paper presents a real-time approach for single-colored ball detectionand tracking. The approach consists of two main phases. In a first offlinecalibration phase, the intrinsic parameters of the camera and the radialdistortion are estimated, and a classification of colors is learned from asample image of colored balls. The second phase consists of four main steps:(1) color segmentation of the input image into several regions based on theoffline classification, (2) robust estimation of the circle parameters (3)refinement of the circle parameters, and (4) ball tracking. The experimentalresults showed that the approach presents a good compromise between suitabilityfor real-time navigation and robustness to occlusions, background congestionand colors interference in the scene.	cs.CV
train_20955	Fissile Locks	  Classic test-and-test (TS) mutual exclusion locks are simple, and enjoy highperformance and low latency of ownership transfer under light or no contention.However, they do not scale gracefully under high contention and do not provideany admission order guarantees. Such concerns led to the development ofscalable queue-based locks, such as a recent Compact NUMA-aware (CNA) lock, avariant of another popular queue-based MCS lock. CNA scales well under load andprovides certain admission guarantees, but has more complicated lock handoveroperations than TS and incurs higher latencies at low contention. We proposeFissile locks, which capture the most desirable properties of both TS and CNA.A Fissile lock consists of two underlying locks: a TS lock, which serves as afast path, and a CNA lock, which serves as a slow path. The key feature ofFissile locks is the ability of threads on the fast path to bypass threadsenqueued on the slow path, and acquire the lock with less overhead than CNA.Bypass is bounded (by a tunable parameter) to avoid starvation and ensurelong-term fairness. The result is a highly scalable NUMA-aware lock withprogress guarantees that performs like TS at low contention and like CNA athigh contention.	cs.OS
train_20152	Multi-robot coverage to locate fixed targets using formation structures	  This paper develops an algorithm that guides a multi-robot system in anunknown environment in search of fixed targets. The area to be scanned containsan unknown number of convex obstacles of unknown size and shape. The algorithmcovers the entire free space in a sweeping fashion and as such relies on theuse of robot formations. The geometry of the robot group is a lateral lineformation, which is allowed to split and rejoin when passing obstacles. It isour main goal to exploit this formation structure in order to reduce robotresources to a minimum. Each robot has a limited and finite amount of memoryavailable. No information of the topography is recorded. Communication betweentwo robots is only possible up to a maximum inter-robot distance, and if theline-of-sight between both robots is not obstructed. Broadcasting capabilitiesand indirect communication are not allowed. Supervisory control is prohibited.The number of robots equipped with GPS is kept as small as possible.Applications of the algorithm are mine field clearance, search-and-rescuemissions, and intercept missions. Simulations are included and made availableon the internet, demonstrating the flexibility of the algorithm.	cs.RO
train_40622	Threshold shift method for reliability-based design optimization	  We present a novel approach, referred to as the 'threshold shift method'(TSM), for reliability based design optimization (RBDO). The proposed approachis similar in spirit with the sequential optimization and reliability analysis(SORA) method where the RBDO problem is decoupled into an optimization and areliability analysis problem. However, unlike SORA that utilizes shift-vectorto shift the design variables within a constraint (independently), in TSM wepropose to shift the threshold of the constraints. We argue that modifying aconstraint, either by shifting the design variables (SORA) or by shifting thethreshold of the constraints (TSM), influences the other constraints of thesystem. Therefore, we propose to determine the thresholds for all theconstraints by solving a single optimization problem. Additionally, theproposed TSM is equipped with an active-constraint determination scheme. Tomake the method scalable, a practical algorithm for TSM that utilizes twosurrogate models is proposed. Unlike the conventional RBDO methods, theproposed approach has the ability to handle highly non-linear probabilisticconstraints. The performance of the proposed approach is examined on sixbenchmark problems selected from the literature. The proposed approach yieldsexcellent results outperforming other popular methods in literature. As for thecomputational efficiency, the proposed approach is found to be highlyefficient, indicating it's future application to other real-life problems.	cs.NA

In this study, we address an aspect of theirlongevity by considering the likelihood that they will be discovered in thecode across versions. We approximate well-disguised vulnerabilities as onlybeing discoverable if the relevant lines of code are explicitly examined, andobvious vulnerabilities as being discoverable if any part of the relevant fileis examined. We analyze the version-to-version changes in three types of opensource software (Mozilla Firefox, GNU/Linus, and glibc) to understand the rateat which the various pieces of code are amended and find that much of therevision behavior can be captured with a simple intuitive model. We use thatmodel and the data from over a billion unique lines of code in 87 differentversions of software to specify the bounds for in-code discoverability ofvulnerabilities - from expertly hidden to obviously observable.	cs.CR
train_34181	Meta-Heuristic Solutions to a Student Grouping Optimization Problem  faced in Higher Education Institutions	  Combinatorial problems which have been proven to be NP-hard are faced inHigher Education Institutions and researches have extensively investigated someof the well-known combinatorial problems such as the timetabling and studentproject allocation problems. However, NP-hard problems faced in HigherEducation Institutions are not only confined to these categories ofcombinatorial problems. The majority of NP-hard problems faced in institutionsinvolve grouping students and/or resources, albeit with each problem having itsown unique set of constraints. Thus, it can be argued that techniques to solveNP-hard problems in Higher Education Institutions can be transferred across thedifferent problem categories. As no method is guaranteed to outperform allothers in all problems, it is necessary to investigate heuristic techniques forsolving lesser-known problems in order to guide stakeholders or softwaredevelopers to the most appropriate algorithm for each unique class of NP-hardproblems faced in Higher Education Institutions. To this end, this studydescribed an optimization problem faced in a real university that involvedgrouping students for the presentation of semester results. Ordering basedheuristics, genetic algorithm and the ant colony optimization algorithmimplemented in Python programming language were used to find feasible solutionsto this problem, with the ant colony optimization algorithm performing betteror equal in 75% of the test instances and the genetic algorithm producingbetter or equal results in 38% of the test instances.	cs.AI

Such design allows newfunctionalities of text processing to be attached onto a running applicationwithout any tweaking of code. We also introduce OpenVanilla, a cross-platformframework that is designed with the above-mentioned model in mind.

train_30340	Neural networks with differentiable structure	  While gradient descent has proven highly successful in learning connectionweights for neural networks, the actual structure of these networks is usuallydetermined by hand, or by other optimization algorithms. Here we describe asimple method to make network structure differentiable, and thereforeaccessible to gradient descent. We test this method on recurrent neuralnetworks applied to simple sequence prediction problems. Starting with initialnetworks containing only one node, the method automatically builds networksthat successfully solve the tasks. The number of nodes in the final networkcorrelates with task difficulty. The method can dynamically increase networksize in response to an abrupt complexification in the task; however, reductionin network size in response to task simplification is not evident forreasonable meta-parameters. The method does not penalize network performancefor these test tasks: variable-size networks actually reach better performancethan fixed-size networks of higher, lower or identical size. We conclude bydiscussing how this method could be applied to more complex networks, such asfeedforward layered networks, or multiple-area networks of arbitrary shape.	cs.NE

In particular, wereport on an experiment where 1 million decimals of $$\pi$$ and the billionthhexadecimal (without the preceding ones) have been computed in a formallyverified way. Three methods have been studied, the first one relying on aspigot formula to obtain at a reasonable cost only one distant digit (moreprecisely a hexadecimal digit, because the numeration basis is 16) and theother two relying on arithmetic-geometric means.

train_38628	Symmetry Breaking with Polynomial Delay	  A conservative class of constraint satisfaction problems CSPs is a class forwhich membership is preserved under arbitrary domain reductions. Manywell-known tractable classes of CSPs are conservative. It is well known thatlexleader constraints may significantly reduce the number of solutions byexcluding symmetric solutions of CSPs. We show that adding certain lexleaderconstraints to any instance of any conservative class of CSPs still allows usto find all solutions with a time which is polynomial between successivesolutions. The time is polynomial in the total size of the instance and theadditional lexleader constraints. It is well known that for complete symmetrybreaking one may need an exponential number of lexleader constraints. However,in practice, the number of additional lexleader constraints is typicallypolynomial number in the size of the instance. For polynomially many lexleaderconstraints, we may in general not have complete symmetry breaking butpolynomially many lexleader constraints may provide practically useful symmetrybreaking -- and they sometimes exclude super-exponentially many solutions. Weprove that for any instance from a conservative class, the time between findingsuccessive solutions of the instance with polynomially many additionallexleader constraints is polynomial even in the size of the instance withoutlexleaderconstraints.	cs.AI
train_08626	Novel Adaptive Genetic Algorithm Sample Consensus	  Random sample consensus (RANSAC) is a successful algorithm in model fittingapplications. It is vital to have strong exploration phase when there are anenormous amount of outliers within the dataset. Achieving a proper model isguaranteed by pure exploration strategy of RANSAC. However, finding the optimumresult requires exploitation. GASAC is an evolutionary paradigm to addexploitation capability to the algorithm. Although GASAC improves the resultsof RANSAC, it has a fixed strategy for balancing between exploration andexploitation. In this paper, a new paradigm is proposed based on geneticalgorithm with an adaptive strategy. We utilize an adaptive genetic operator toselect high fitness individuals as parents and mutate low fitness ones. In themutation phase, a training method is used to gradually learn which gene is thebest replacement for the mutated gene. The proposed method adaptively balancebetween exploration and exploitation by learning about genes. During the finalIterations, the algorithm draws on this information to improve the finalresults. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on two set ofexperiments. In all tests, our method outperformed the other methods in termsof both the number of inliers found and the speed of the algorithm.	cs.NE

In particular, such applications operate on extremely large data setsand have irregular memory access patterns. For efficient parallelization ofsuch applications, it is necessary to support dynamic load balancing along withscheduling mechanisms that allow users to exploit data locality. Given theserequirements, task parallelism is the most promising of the available parallelprogramming models. However, existing solutions for task parallelism scheduletasks implicitly and hence, custom scheduling policies that can exploit datalocality cannot be easily employed.

This paperpresents a novel approach, which bridges the gap between these two categoriesof networks. In particular, we propose an architecture which takes advantage ofthe explicit, sequential enumeration of the word history in FNN structure whileenhancing each word representation at the projection layer through recurrentcontext information that evolves in the network. The context integration isperformed using an additional word-dependent weight matrix that is also learnedduring the training. Extensive experiments conducted on the Penn Treebank (PTB)and the Large Text Compression Benchmark (LTCB) corpus showed a significantreduction of the perplexity when compared to state-of-the-art feedforward aswell as recurrent neural network architectures.	cs.CL

Various learning approaches have beenapplied in the past to different stages of the matching pipeline, consideringdetector, descriptor, or metric learning objectives. These objectives weretypically addressed separately and most previous work has focused on imagedata. This paper proposes an end-to-end learning framework for keypointdetection and its representation (descriptor) for 3D depth maps or 3D scans,where the two can be jointly optimized towards task-specific objectives withouta need for separate annotations. We employ a Siamese architecture augmented bya sampling layer and a novel score loss function which in turn affects theselection of region proposals. The positive and negative examples are obtainedautomatically by sampling corresponding region proposals based on theirconsistency with known 3D pose labels. Matching experiments with depth data onmultiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach,showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.	cs.CV

Unfortunately, the multi-energyprojection dataset always contains strong complicated noise and result in theprojections has a lower signal-noise-ratio (SNR). Very recently, thespatial-spectral cube matching frame (SSCMF) was proposed to explore thenon-local spatial-spectrum similarities for spectral CT. The method constructssuch a group by clustering up a series of non-local spatial-spectrum cubes. Thesmall size of spatial patch for such a group make SSCMF fails to encode thesparsity and low-rank properties. In addition, the hard-thresholding andcollaboration filtering operation in the SSCMF are also rough to recover theimage features and spatial edges. While for all steps are operated on 4-Dgroup, we may not afford such huge computational and memory load in practical.To avoid the above limitation and further improve image quality, we firstformulate a non-local cube-based tensor instead of the group to encode thesparsity and low-rank properties. Then, as a new regularizer,Kronecker-Basis-Representation (KBR) tensor factorization is employed into abasic spectral CT reconstruction model to enhance the ability of extractingimage features and protecting spatial edges, generating the non-local low-rankcube-based tensor factorization (NLCTF) method. Finally, the split-Bregmanstrategy is adopted to solve the NLCTF model. Both numerical simulations andrealistic preclinical mouse studies are performed to validate and assess theNLCTF algorithm. The results show that the NLCTF method outperforms the othercompetitors.	cs.CV

The WNoCparadigm has been extensively analyzed from the physical, network andarchitecture perspectives assuming mmWave band operation. However, there hasnot been a comprehensive study at this band for realistic chip packages and,thus, the characteristics of such wireless channel remain not fully understood.This work addresses this issue by accurately modeling a flip-chip package andinvestigating the wave propagation inside it. Through parametric studies, alocally optimal configuration for 60 GHz WNoC is obtained, showing thatchip-wide attenuation below 32.6 dB could be achieved with standard processes.Finally, the applicability of the methodology is discussed for higher bands andother integrated environments such as a Software-Defined Metamaterial (SDM).	cs.ET

Type-preserving compilation canbe used to preserve these specifications and proofs of correctness throughcompilation into the generated target-language programs. Unfortunately,type-preserving compilation of dependent types is hard. In essence, the problemis that dependent type systems are designed around high-level compositionalabstractions to decide type checking, but compilation interferes with thetype-system rules for reasoning about run-time terms.  We develop a type-preserving closure-conversion translation from the Calculusof Constructions (CC) with strong dependent pairs ($\Sigma$ types)---a subsetof the core language of Coq---to a type-safe, dependently typed compilerintermediate language named CC-CC. The central challenge in this work is how totranslate the source type-system rules for reasoning about functions intotarget type-system rules for reasoning about closures. To justify these rules,we prove soundness of CC-CC by giving a model in CC. In addition to typepreservation, we prove correctness of separate compilation.	cs.PL

However, the THz band brings novelchallenges, never addressed at lower frequencies. Among others, the scatteringof THz waves from any object, including walls and furniture, and ultra-widebandhighly-directional links lead to fundamentally new propagation and interferencestructures.

train_18948	Asynchronous Stochastic Approximation Based Learning Algorithms for  As-You-Go Deployment of Wireless Relay Networks along a Line	  We are motivated by the need for impromptu (or as-you-go) deployment ofmultihop wireless networks, by human agents or robots; the agent moves along aline, makes wireless link quality measurements at regular intervals, and makeson-line placement decisions using these measurements. As a first step, we haveformulated such deployment along a line as a sequential decision problem. Inour earlier work, we proposed two possible deployment approaches: (i) the pureas-you-go approach where the deployment agent can only move forward, and (ii)the explore-forward approach where the deployment agent explores a fewsuccessive steps and then selects the best relay placement location. The latterwas shown to provide better performance but at the expense of more measurementsand deployment time, which makes explore-forward impractical for quickdeployment by an energy constrained agent such as a UAV. Further, thedeployment algorithm should not require prior knowledge of the parameters ofthe wireless propagation model. In [1] we, therefore, developed learningalgorithms for the explore-forward approach.  The current paper provides deploy-and-learn algorithms for the pure as-you-goapproach. We formulate the sequential relay deployment problem as an averagecost Markov decision process (MDP), which trades off among power consumption,link outage probabilities, and the number of deployed relay nodes. First weshow structural results for the optimal policy. Next, by exploiting the specialstructure of the optimality equation and by using the theory of asynchronousstochastic approximation, we develop two learning algorithms thatasymptotically converge to the set of optimal policies as deploymentprogresses. Numerical results show reasonably fast speed of convergence, andhence the model-free algorithms can be useful for practical, fast deployment ofemergency wireless networks.	cs.NI

In thispaper, we propose a novel training method called manifold-matching, and a newGAN model called manifold-matching GAN (MMGAN). MMGAN finds two manifoldsrepresenting the vector representations of real and fake images. If these twomanifolds match, it means that real and fake images are statisticallyidentical. To assist the manifold-matching task, we also use i) kernel tricksto find better manifold structures, ii) moving-averaged manifolds acrossmini-batches, and iii) a regularizer based on correlation matrix to suppressmode collapse.  We conduct in-depth experiments with three image datasets and compare withseveral state-of-the-art GAN models. 32.4% of images generated by the proposedMMGAN are recognized as fake images during our user study (16% enhancementcompared to other state-of-the-art model).

train_44966	PaToPaEM: A Data-Driven Parameter and Topology Joint Estimation  Framework for Time Varying System in Distribution Grids	  Grid topology and line parameters are essential for grid operation andplanning, which may be missing or inaccurate in distribution grids. Existingdata-driven approaches for recovering such information usually suffer fromignoring 1) input measurement errors and 2) possible state changes amonghistorical measurements. While using the errors-in-variables (EIV) model andletting the parameter and topology estimation interact with each other (PaToPa)can address input and output measurement error modeling, it only works when allmeasurements are from a single system state. To solve the two challengessimultaneously, we propose the PaToPaEM framework for joint line parameter andtopology estimation with historical measurements from different unknown states.We improve the static framework that only works when measurements are from onesingle state, by further treating state changes in historical measurements asan unobserved latent variable. We then systematically analyze the newmathematical modeling, decouple the optimization problem, and incorporate theexpectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to recover different hidden states inmeasurements. Combining these, PaToPaEM framework enables joint topology andline parameter estimation using noisy measurements from multiple system states.It lays a solid foundation for data-driven system identification indistribution grids. Superior numerical results validate the practicability ofthe PaToPaEM framework.	cs.SY

In this paper we introduce a confluent non-idempotentintersection type system for the lambda-calculus. Typing derivations arepresented using proof term syntax. The system enjoys good properties: subjectreduction, strong normalization, and a very regular theory of residuals. Acorrespondence with the lambda-calculus is established by simulation theorems.The machinery of non-idempotent intersection types allows us to track the usageof resources required to obtain an answer. In particular, it induces a notionof garbage: a computation is garbage if it does not contribute to obtaining ananswer. Using these notions, we show that the derivation space of a lambda-termmay be factorized using a variant of the Grothendieck construction forsemilattices. This means, in particular, that any derivation in thelambda-calculus can be uniquely written as a garbage-free prefix followed bygarbage.	cs.LO

train_42619	Improved Kernels for Tracking Path Problem	  Tracking of moving objects is crucial to security systems and networks. Givena graph $G$, terminal vertices $s$ and $t$, and an integer $k$, the\textsc{Tracking Paths} problem asks whether there exists at most $k$ vertices,which if marked as trackers, would ensure that the sequence of trackersencountered in each s-t path is unique. It is known that the problem is NP-hardand admits a kernel (reducible to an equivalent instance) with$\mathcal{O}(k^6)$ vertices and $\mathcal{O}(k^7)$ edges, when parameterized bythe size of the output (tracking set) $k$ [5]. An interesting question thatremains open is whether the existing kernel can be improved. In this paper weanswer this affirmatively: (i) For general graphs, we show the existence of akernel of size $\mathcal{O}(k^2)$, (ii) For planar graphs, we improve thisfurther by giving a kernel of size $\mathcal{O}(k)$. In addition, we also showthat finding a tracking set of size at most $n-k$ for a graph on $n$ verticesis hard for the parameterized complexity class W[1], when parameterized by $k$.	cs.DS
train_46157	Text Region Extraction from Business Card Images for Mobile Devices	  Designing a Business Card Reader (BCR) for mobile devices is a challenge tothe researchers because of huge deformation in acquired images, multiplicity innature of the business cards and most importantly the computational constraintsof the mobile devices. This paper presents a text extraction method designed inour work towards developing a BCR for mobile devices. At first, the backgroundof a camera captured image is eliminated at a coarse level. Then, various rulebased techniques are applied on the Connected Components (CC) to filter out thenoises and picture regions. The CCs identified as text are then binarized usingan adaptive but light-weight binarization technique. Experiments show that thetext extraction accuracy is around 98% for a wide range of resolutions withvarying computation time and memory requirements. The optimum performance isachieved for the images of resolution 1024x768 pixels with text extractionaccuracy of 98.54% and, space and time requirements as 1.1 MB and 0.16 secondsrespectively.	cs.CV
train_18546	Wavelet based Watermarking approach in the Compressive Sensing Scenario	  Due to the wide distribution and usage of digital media, an important issueis protection of the digital content. There is a number of algorithms andtechniques developed for the digital watermarking.In this paper, the invisibleimage watermark procedure is considered. Watermark is created as a pseudorandom sequence, embedded in the certain region of the image, obtained usingHaar wavelet decomposition. Generally, the watermarking procedure should berobust to the various attacks-filtering, noise etc. Here we assume theCompressive sensing scenario as a new signal processing technique that mayinfluence the robustness. The focus of this paper was the possibility of thewatermark detection under Compressive Sensing attack with different number ofavailable image coefficients. The quality of the reconstructed images has beenevaluated using Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR).The theory is supported withexperimental results.	cs.MM
train_29189	Detecting unseen visual relations using analogies	  We seek to detect visual relations in images of the form of triplets t =(subject, predicate, object), such as "person riding dog", where trainingexamples of the individual entities are available but their combinations areunseen at training. This is an important set-up due to the combinatorial natureof visual relations : collecting sufficient training data for all possibletriplets would be very hard. The contributions of this work are three-fold.First, we learn a representation of visual relations that combines (i)individual embeddings for subject, object and predicate together with (ii) avisual phrase embedding that represents the relation triplet. Second, we learnhow to transfer visual phrase embeddings from existing training triplets tounseen test triplets using analogies between relations that involve similarobjects. Third, we demonstrate the benefits of our approach on threechallenging datasets : on HICO-DET, our model achieves significant improvementover a strong baseline for both frequent and unseen triplets, and we observesimilar improvement for the retrieval of unseen triplets with out-of-vocabularypredicates on the COCO-a dataset as well as the challenging unusual triplets inthe UnRel dataset.	cs.CV
train_00022	Utilizing Mask R-CNN for Waterline Detection in Canoe Sprint Video  Analysis	  Determining a waterline in images recorded in canoe sprint training is animportant component for the kinematic parameter analysis to assess an athlete'sperformance. Here, we propose an approach for the automated waterlinedetection. First, we utilized a pre-trained Mask R-CNN by means of transferlearning for canoe segmentation. Second, we developed a multi-stage approach toestimate a waterline from the outline of the segments. It consists of twolinear regression stages and the systematic selection of canoe parts. We thenintroduced a parameterization of the waterline as a basis for furtherevaluations. Next, we conducted a study among several experts to estimate theground truth waterlines. This not only included an average waterline drawn fromthe individual experts annotations but, more importantly, a measure for theuncertainty between individual results. Finally, we assessed our method withrespect to the question whether the predicted waterlines are in accordance withthe experts annotations. Our method demonstrated a high performance andprovides opportunities for new applications in the field of automated videoanalysis in canoe sprint.	cs.CV
train_43240	Fully dynamic recognition of proper circular-arc graphs	  We present a fully dynamic algorithm for the recognition of propercircular-arc (PCA) graphs. The allowed operations on the graph involve theinsertion and removal of vertices (together with its incident edges) or edges.Edge operations cost O(log n) time, where n is the number of vertices of thegraph, while vertex operations cost O(log n + d) time, where d is the degree ofthe modified vertex. We also show incremental and decremental algorithms thatwork in O(1) time per inserted or removed edge. As part of our algorithm, fullydynamic connectivity and co-connectivity algorithms that work in O(log n) timeper operation are obtained. Also, an O(\Delta) time algorithm for determiningif a PCA representation corresponds to a co-bipartite graph is provided, where\Delta\ is the maximum among the degrees of the vertices. When the graph isco-bipartite, a co-bipartition of each of its co-components is obtained withinthe same amount of time.	cs.DS

The quality of such lists are evaluated by a submodular rewardfunction that measures both quality and diversity. Similar to DAgger (Ross etal., 2010), by a reduction to online learning, we show how to adapt twosequence prediction models to imitate greedy maximization under knapsackconstraint problems: CONSEQOPT (Dey et al., 2012) and SCP (Ross et al., 2013).Experiments on extractive multi-document summarization show that our approachoutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.	cs.LG
train_19594	Adapting the Hypercube Model to Archive Deferred Representations and  Their Descendants	  The web is today's primary publication medium, making web archiving animportant activity for historical and analytical purposes. Web pages areincreasingly interactive, resulting in pages that are increasingly difficult toarchive. Client-side technologies (e.g., JavaScript) enable interactions thatcan potentially change the client-side state of a representation. We refer torepresentations that load embedded resources via JavaScript as deferredrepresentations. It is difficult to archive all of the resources in deferredrepresentations and the result is archives with web pages that are eitherincomplete or that erroneously load embedded resources from the live web.  We propose a method of discovering and crawling deferred representations andtheir descendants (representation states that are only reachable throughclient-side events). We adapt the Dincturk et al. Hypercube model to constructa model for archiving descendants, and we measure the number of descendants andrequisite embedded resources discovered in a proof-of-concept crawl. Ourapproach identified an average of 38.5 descendants per seed URI crawled, 70.9%of which are reached through an onclick event. This approach also added 15.6times more embedded resources than Heritrix to the crawl frontier, but at arate that was 38.9 times slower than simply using Heritrix. We show that ourdataset has two levels of descendants. We conclude with proposed crawl policiesand an analysis of the storage requirements for archiving descendants.	cs.DL
train_03876	Orthogonal Matrix Retrieval in Cryo-Electron Microscopy	  In single particle reconstruction (SPR) from cryo-electron microscopy(cryo-EM), the 3D structure of a molecule needs to be determined from its 2Dprojection images taken at unknown viewing directions. Zvi Kam showed alreadyin 1980 that the autocorrelation function of the 3D molecule over the rotationgroup SO(3) can be estimated from 2D projection images whose viewing directionsare uniformly distributed over the sphere. The autocorrelation functiondetermines the expansion coefficients of the 3D molecule in spherical harmonicsup to an orthogonal matrix of size $(2l+1)\times (2l+1)$ for each$l=0,1,2,...$. In this paper we show how techniques for solving the phaseretrieval problem in X-ray crystallography can be modified for the cryo-EMsetup for retrieving the missing orthogonal matrices. Specifically, we presenttwo new approaches that we term Orthogonal Extension and OrthogonalReplacement, in which the main algorithmic components are the singular valuedecomposition and semidefinite programming. We demonstrate the utility of theseapproaches through numerical experiments on simulated data.	cs.CV
train_29200	Push-pull direct modeling of solid CAD models	  Direct modeling is a very recent CAD modeling paradigm featuring direct,intuitive push-pull interactions with the geometry of the model to muchincrease model editing flexibility. The major issue for push-pull directmodeling is the possible inconsistency between the altered geometry of themodel and its unchanged topology. The challenge of resolving thegeometry-topology inconsistency lies in ensuring that the resulting modelremains as a valid solid model and that the model shape follows a continuouschange pattern. Although push-pull direct modeling has been implemented inseveral CAD software packages, robustness towards generating valid modelingresults and continuous shape changes still remains an open issue. This paperproposes a systematic method to handle the resolution of any possibleinconsistent situation. The method formulates the continuous shape changerequirement as successive Boolean operations on the model volume, therebyguaranteeing valid solid models and continuous shape changes. Further, thisformulation allows for an easy implementation of push-pull direct modelingusing existing CAD research and engineering results. In order to show theeffectiveness of the proposed method, a software prototype is developed and themodeling results are compared with those of five leading CAD software packages.	cs.CG

train_34560	The Budgeted Transportation Problem	  Consider a transportation problem with sets of sources and sinks. There areprofits and prices on the edges. The goal is to maximize the profit whilemeeting the following constraints; the total flow going out of a source mustnot exceed its capacity and the total price of the incoming flow on a sink mustnot exceed its budget. This problem is closely related to the generalized flowproblem.  We propose an auction based primal dual approximation algorithm to solve theproblem. The complexity is $O(\epsilon^{-1}(n^2+ n\log{m})m\log U)$ where $n$is the number of sources, $m$ is the number of sinks, $U$ is the ratio of themaximum profit/price to the minimum profit/price.  We also show how to generalize the scheme to solve a more general version ofthe problem, where there are edge capacities and/or the profit function isconcave and piece-wise linear. The complexity of the algorithm depends on thenumber of linear segments, termed ${\cal L}$, of the profit function.	cs.DS

Korean verbs change their forms ina fickle manner depending on tense, mood, speech level, meaning, etc.Therefore, it is challenging to construct comprehensive conjugation paradigmsof Korean verbs. In this paper we introduce a Korean (verb) conjugationparadigm generator, dubbed KoParadigm. To the best of our knowledge, it is thefirst Korean conjugation module that covers all contemporary Korean verbs andendings. KoParadigm is not only linguistically well established, but alsocomputationally simple and efficient. We share it via PyPi.	cs.CL
train_35490	A Survey on Consensus Mechanisms and Mining Strategy Management in  Blockchain Networks	  The past decade has witnessed the rapid evolution in blockchain technologies,which has attracted tremendous interests from both the research communities andindustries. The blockchain network was originated from the Internet financialsector as a decentralized, immutable ledger system for transactional dataordering. Nowadays, it is envisioned as a powerful backbone/framework fordecentralized data processing and data-driven self-organization in flat,open-access networks. In particular, the plausible characteristics ofdecentralization, immutability and self-organization are primarily owing to theunique decentralized consensus mechanisms introduced by blockchain networks.This survey is motivated by the lack of a comprehensive literature review onthe development of decentralized consensus mechanisms in blockchain networks.In this survey, we provide a systematic vision of the organization ofblockchain networks. By emphasizing the unique characteristics of incentivizedconsensus in blockchain networks, our in-depth review of the state-of-the-artconsensus protocols is focused on both the perspective of distributed consensussystem design and the perspective of incentive mechanism design. From agame-theoretic point of view, we also provide a thorough review on the strategyadoption for self-organization by the individual nodes in the blockchainbackbone networks. Consequently, we provide a comprehensive survey on theemerging applications of the blockchain networks in a wide range of areas. Wehighlight our special interest in how the consensus mechanisms impact theseapplications. Finally, we discuss several open issues in the protocol designfor blockchain consensus and the related potential research directions.	cs.CR
train_46182	Phoenix: Towards Persistently Secure, Recoverable, and NVM Friendly Tree  of Counters	  Emerging Non-Volatile Memories (NVMs) bring a unique challenge to thesecurity community, namely persistent security. As NVM-based memories areexpected to restore their data after recovery, the security metadata must berecovered as well. However, persisting all affected security metadata on eachmemory write would significantly degrade performance and exacerbate the writeendurance problem. Moreover, recovery time can increase significantly (up tohours for practical memory sizes) when security metadata are not updatedstrictly. Counter trees are used in state-of-the-art commercial secureprocessors, e.g., Intel's Safe Guard Extension (SGX). Counter trees have aunique challenge due to the inability to recover the whole tree from leaves.Thus, to ensure recoverability, all updates to the tree must be persisted,which can be tens of additional writes on each write. The state-of-art scheme,Anubis, enables recoverability but incurs an additional write per cacheeviction, i.e., reduces lifetime to approximately half. Additionally, Anubisdegrades performance significantly in many cases. In this paper, we proposePhoenix, a practical novel scheme which relies on elegantly reproducing thecache content before a crash, however with minimal overheads. Our evaluationresults show that Phoenix reduces persisting security metadata overhead writesfrom 87\% extra writes (for Anubis) to less than write-back compared to anencrypted system without recovery, thus improving the NVM lifetime by 2x.Overall Phoenix performance is better than the baseline, unlike Anubis whichadds 7.9\% (max of 35\%) performance overhead.	cs.CR
train_26626	FastBDT: A speed-optimized and cache-friendly implementation of  stochastic gradient-boosted decision trees for multivariate classification	  Stochastic gradient-boosted decision trees are widely employed formultivariate classification and regression tasks. This paper presents aspeed-optimized and cache-friendly implementation for multivariateclassification called FastBDT. FastBDT is one order of magnitude faster duringthe fitting-phase and application-phase, in comparison with popularimplementations in software frameworks like TMVA, scikit-learn and XGBoost. Theconcepts used to optimize the execution time and performance studies arediscussed in detail in this paper. The key ideas include: An equal-frequencybinning on the input data, which allows replacing expensive floating-point withinteger operations, while at the same time increasing the quality of theclassification; a cache-friendly linear access pattern to the input data, incontrast to usual implementations, which exhibit a random access pattern.FastBDT provides interfaces to C/C++, Python and TMVA. It is extensively usedin the field of high energy physics by the Belle II experiment.	cs.LG
train_42466	Automaton based detection of affected cells in three dimensional  biological system	  The aim of this research review is to propose the logic and search mechanismfor the development of an artificially intelligent automaton (AIA) that canfind affected cells in a 3-dimensional biological system. Research on thepossible application of such automatons to detect and control cancer cells inthe human body are greatly focused MRI and PET scans finds the affected regionsat the tissue level even as we can find the affected regions at the cellularlevel using the framework. The AIA may be designed to ensure optimumutilization as they record and might control the presence of affected cells ina human body. The proposed models and techniques can be generalized and used inany application where cells are injured or affected by some disease oraccident. The best method to import AIA into the body without surgery orinjection is to insert small pill like automata, carrying material viz drugs orleukocytes that is needed to correct the infection. In this process, the AIAcan be compared to nano pills to deliver or support therapy. NanoHivesimulation software was used to validate the framework of this paper. Theexisting nanomedicine models such as obstacle avoidance algorithm based models(Hla K H S et al 2008) and the framework in this model were tested in differentsimulation based experiments. The existing models such as obstacle avoidancebased models failed in complex environmental conditions (such as changingenvironmental conditions, presence of semi-solid particles, etc) while themodel in this paper executed its framework successfully.Come systems biology,this field of automatons deserves a bigger leap of understanding especiallywhen pharmacogenomics is at its peak. The results also indicate the importanceof artificial intelligence and other computational capabilities in the proposedmodel for the successful detection of affected cells.	cs.CE
